runthereszombies,"Got a really nice compliment about my OSCE assessment today, and it made me happier than I've felt since starting med school","Im a medical student in the US. At the end of the year, every US med student has to complete a several hours long assessment called an OSCE, where you conduct 5 or 6 doctors appointments with a variety of people who have a variety of complaints.  The patients are trained actors.  Anything from a stomach ache to a stroke, and you dont know what it is until you walk into the exam room.  Our OSCEs are running this month and I did mine yesterday.  I didnt know how to feel about it because I've been having a lot of self doubt about my ability to do this thing.  Today, I was waiting to go into a class when I heard my name being called from behind me.  I turned around and the director of the program that trains the actors approached me to compliment me on the OSCE I had with her the day before.

LittleTreeGirl,I made a shirt for myself based on counseling! :) Feeling happy/proud so I wanted to share!,"Hi everyone! I hope you are all happy and healthy - or working towards it :) 

I just got a Cricut and wanted to try making a shirt so this is my first attempt. (I'll explain it first)

I really struggle with self-confidence - I have such a hard time thinking that I am pretty enough, or smart enough, or good enough for anything- but my counselor has really been helping me feel like I am a decent person who deserves to be happy! So I was telling him the other day how grateful I am that he's planting the seeds that I am good enough and that I deserve to be happy. But - I realized that wasn't what I meant. 

For years professors have told me I'm smart, or that I'm doing a good job. Strangers and friends compliment my appearance or my personality. But those seeds never take root. Any seeds that have been planted haven't been able to grow because my garden is just too dry and uncared for. So I think it's more accurate to say my counselor is watering my garden! :-p He is/ he's helping me make my garden/mind a place where the old and new seeds can take root and grow! :) and I liked that analogy for all of counseling really. Counselors help us make our mind into a healthier place so we can grow confidence, happiness, and everything else we need! :) 

So I made a shirt to remind me to keep working on watering my garden and making my mind a place that fosters all the good I want in my life :) 

Here it is :) I know it's not much but it's the first thing I've drawn, designed, or made into a shirt so it's still pretty cool lol

BicAsschecks69,Stop Self-pity and beginn with Self-help,"Hello everyone,

I hope this gets to the people that also like me, have the urge of helping others and to find deep-meaning within it, to acknowledge that life can be difficult but also that something can be done about it when we exchange each other's expierences and start the process of self help.

I would love to help anybody in need of it or just to talk about interesting topics.

For this cause I made a Discord server, where I hope someday a lot of people will take part in, especially in these times of economic stagnation and Covid( I know I can't stand this word either).

So let's do something about it and make the best out of the Situation, I am open for suggestions and discussions about anything.

Val_Squidson,"I have awesome college ‚Äúsisters‚Äù and I‚Äôm so lucky to have them in my life, especially now","College is hard and that‚Äôs a fact :‚ÄôD I had a really hard time making friends this year due to Covid and such and I spent a lot of time in my room. One day I ran into an acquaintance‚Äîwe‚Äôll call her Mari‚Äîwho I met through a club. She asked me if I was going to head to lunch, I said yes, and we ate together. She introduced me to all of her friends, and we had a blast.

I started hanging out with Mari a lot more after that day. I had just fallen out with my old friend group so Mari took me in as her ‚Äúlittle sister.‚Äù She was really sweet, and I got a lot closer with her, her roommate Cali, and another friend Nation. We spent a lot of time together this semester, eating almost every meal together and hanging out almost every night. Cali and Nation have also adopted me as a ‚Äúlittle sister.‚Äù

Things at college have been really tense. I don‚Äôt want to accidentally turn this into a ‚Äúsilver lining‚Äù post so I won‚Äôt go into details. But for the whole semester I‚Äôve been having really bad nightmares and hallucinations. I also can never sleep the whole night because my dorm room is close to the front door and people scream like chimpanzees walking in. So Mari and Cali offered to clean up the third bed and let me sleep in their room. I‚Äôve been there for many days since they first offered and it‚Äôs helped a lot.

Tonight I had a panic attack. I didn‚Äôt want to call my parents or my therapist for whatever reason (ig because I‚Äôm tired of depending on them so much?) so I called Mari. She came right over to my room and spent probably an hour with me just hugging me and comforting me as I cried in her arms. She spent another half hour listening to me complain about life and explain what in the world is running through my head. I cried about how I was so scared about losing her and stressing her out and she was so reassuring. Whenever I was highly stressed, my previous friends would say they would always be there for me (spoiler alert: they weren‚Äôt). Mari said that as well, but she also added that I deserved friends who could care for me like this at the bare minimum.

Duke581,I succeded in accomplishing my body goals in a year with a plot twist.,"So, a year ago I was unsatisfied with my body. I have been overweight for almost my entire life and also unsatisfied with my own height. I was very stressed a year ago and I tried everything to calm myself. Then I started cycling for an hour a day. I live in a countryside and I enjoyed nature a lot. It made me calmed down. I also made some differences to my diet, mostly kicking out fast food. I genuenly started to feel happier. I lost about 40 pounds due to my diet change and cycling. But I was still unsatisfied with my height. During last few months, I noticed that I gained some weight, but I still haven't got any bally fat or muscle mass. Yesterday my gf (who was taller than me) asked me if I grew in height. Then I realised that somehow I became as tall as her. I thought it was because of terrain outside or shoes, but I measured myself today. I grew 2 inches since last year. Thing is, that I thought I wouldn't grow anymore (since I am almost 20 years old). I am so happy, and I wanted to share this with someone!

subbratkinky,My mother in law compared me to Martha Stuart,"Let me give some background I love hosting. I love bringing joy to people. I also love being around friends and not having to leave my home. My MIL (mother in law) normally hosts events, but I hosted Easter with my hubs family yesterday. My MIL is also extremely OCD and a germaphobe. We have a good relationship though (we are very different people though.. her idea of camping is staying in a fully furnished cabin while mine is in a hammock under the stars. She likes glam/modern I like rustic..think chip and Joanne gains.. I live on a small farm while she freaks out at the thought of poop). 

We were all sitting around and idk how it came up but I said I'd like to turn the farm into a wedding venue one day and I even came up with a name ""Oak Grove Farms"" or ""the original OG"" cue chuckles. Apparently MIL didn't know what OG meant so my SIL explained it to her. MIL then said ""oh my goodness, you are not a gangster if anything you're more like Martha Stuart."" 

Y'all I don't achieve to be like Martha Stuart, but my MIL is one of the hardest people to please when it comes to hosting and that was seriously the best compliment she could have ever given me. Of course we then went into the conversation that Martha Stuart and snoop dog are friends and only one of them is a convicted felon but hey.

Ledifen,"This week, I've been consistently happy/satisfied with what I create after years of trying to be","I'm a perfectionnist, so *of course* I'm never happy with my work/my creations.

But 6 years ago I realised this ""never satisfied by my work"" mindset was screwing me over. Ever since then, I've been trying to look at my work like I look at other's work: always pointing out what is good.

And finally, after a few month of doing what I love because I love it and not because I have an exam (I just graduated), I realised I was happy with what I was doing. 

It's amazing, I've come such a long way. The project I'm working on (a CG 3D scene recreating a corner of my bedrrom) is really coming together. Even better, I'm downright proud because I stumbled upon a problem and then realised my 6 weeks younger self had predicted this shit and did everything right to counter it.

sidneyaks,I took the wrong job out of college and it's stunted my career. I've finally broken into the career path I want and am ecstatic.,"Out of college I took a position in Manual Software Quality Assurance, thinking it would be a springboard job to being a software developer. Unfortunately, with that on my resume, most recruiters seemed toss the resume in the trash. Bear in mind, I also had a bachelors in CS, so it wasn't like I could go back to school and ""reinvent myself"" (unless I wanted to get a masters, which I couldn't really manager working full time); I already had the requisite qualifications for the job I'm looking for, but with QA being front and center on the resume hiring managers looked past me.

After about five years of manual to automated QA, working to improve my abilities and make myself stand out, I've been offered a position as a software engineer within the same company. I like the company and people, I'm glad I get to stay AND have the position I really want.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mi5ll4/i_took_the_wrong_job_out_of_college_and_its/,2021-04-01 21:33:22,1,4,0

Pax_Libertas_,"During the month of March, I listened to over 800 songs that were posted to Reddit by independent musicians. Whenever I ran into one that blew me away, I added it to this playlist! I'd love to share it here with anyone interested."," Hey everyone! I found a few hidden gems this month that I would love to share with you. The music is separated by platform. Each platform has artists that are unique to it, but it also has some of the same ones. I hope you guys enjoy the music, and thanks for giving these musicians a chance!

TheGirlWithTheLove,Something amazing happened to me at work yesterday.,"I work at a grocery store, and I am autistic. The following story happened to me during the last half hour of my shift.

My usual task at work is to sweep the store. When I got to the deli department, a customer asked me where the hot soup is. I showed her where it is. She told me that she saw a man outside the building who may be homeless, and wanted to give him something warm to eat. I told her, ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs really nice of you to do that!‚Äù We were both struggling to get the lids apart, and I told her that I think I was having trouble with it because my weak right hand. She asked why it‚Äôs weak. I asked if she‚Äôd have a problem if I got too personal, and she said that it‚Äôs fine. I told her that I was born prematurely, and besides having autism, I had a brain aneurysm that made the right side of my body weak. She apologized out of sympathy, but I just told her, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt apologize! I lived with it my whole life. It makes me have something that not many people have.‚Äù

After getting the soup, she tells me that she needs to buy a few more things. I tell her that I can help her look for them. While we were walking, I asked if she‚Äôs been to the store before. She said that she hasn‚Äôt been there in a few years. She also opened up to me about how she moved back to town with her dad because she‚Äôs been struggling with mental issues. I could tell that she was comfortable enough to tell me that. And I totally understand that sometimes, customers just need someone to listen to them. I really appreciated that. She talked to me like I was an old friend of hers. At one point, she even offered to buy me a lunch, but I told her that my shift was almost over, so I didn‚Äôt need anything. But I let her know that I really appreciated her offering.

By the time I walked to to a register to check out, my shift was over, and I still needed to complete the store sweep, but I didn‚Äôt care. She thanked me for helping her. What she told me next really surprised me. She said that she would love to see me again, and go out for lunch or something. I told her that that would be awesome, as pretty much all of my friends live out of state. I have a set work schedule, so I told her which days I work. I told her that I had a stressful day (everyone getting ready for Easter), and she made my day so much better. She gave me a whole bunch of hugs, introduced herself to me, and told me she‚Äôd see me later. I ended up making a new friend. Emily, if you happen to read this, thank you for being so kind. You have a good heart, and you are a beautiful person. I hope this will be the start to a great friendship.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mhzfds/something_amazing_happened_to_me_at_work_yesterday/,2021-04-01 16:46:23,1,5,0

kentuckychicken1987,Feeling happy for the first time in a while,"Today seems like the first really good day in a long time, and shit seems to be falling back into place. Here‚Äôs why:

1. A few days ago I was feeling suicidal and pretty much posted a suicide note saying goodbye to the world, and yesterday a good friend who I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd hear from again saw it and urged me not to commit suicide, it honestly got me thinking about why it‚Äôs worth it to live. 

2. For the last few days my left ear has been plugged up and this morning I went to my doctor‚Äôs office and he unplugged it, he says I can come back for the same thing if it happens again which will save me the week of agony I had the last time this happened this past January. 

3. I heard lots of songs I genuinely like on the radio in the car today, including Alive by Pearl Jam (must‚Äôve been a message from up above)

4. My favourite flavour of Pepsi, Pepsi Throwback (I‚Äôm a Coke diehard) is back on the shelves where I live, it was an unexpected surprise and a good one at that, been waiting a while to taste the real sugar lol. 

5. It‚Äôs actually very bright and sunny where I live, weather‚Äôs been absolute shit lately so this is really badly needed right now.

I dunno what this is, did God see how I was feeling the lowest of low and decide to help me out? What the fuck? I was feeling ready to end it all and now this... god damn I guess it‚Äôs worth it to live isn‚Äôt it?

E_J_C20,I have finally reached a place of contentment with what I have in life and have grown emotionally strong!,"
It‚Äôs taken a lot of time to reach this point. I‚Äôve got no idea how I really came to this point of contentment and I really just want to write about it as I‚Äôm feeling good even if no one reads it. I‚Äôve always been someone who can get through anything but the last year was a crazy one. 

I 22(f) lost my grandma to covid, who I spent the last week of her life looking after her and listening out to her at night if she fell off the bed it was really heartbreaking. 

I broke up with my bf of 3 years as I was miserable with him as he had such a negative outlook on life. It was just tough as I felt a lot of guilt. 

Lost my cousin to mental health issues, she was admitted to hospital and haven‚Äôt seen her since. She was like my sister. 

Dated a guy whom I thought was amazing, the first guy to introduce me to his family, actually take me out on dates. Who then turned out to be emotionally abusive. 

This triggered a traumatic event in my life to which I held this event for 10 years without telling anyone. I decided to go to therapy which was the best decision I have made. 

I have been dating around, been ghosted, all the crappy stuff. But by the third date something switched in me. I‚Äôm really happy even when things don‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôve grown this confidence in myself that I‚Äôm good with and without someone. I‚Äôve grown strong in all sorts of way, have focused so much on my friendships that I love all the friends I have and tell them I‚Äôm grateful for all of them, focused on my family that I do things now such as make a massive dinner like curry night out of pure joy (never used to do this) and this makes My parents really happy after a long day at work. all of this has contributed to just me being happy with what I have currently. 

Just things are great. And this isn‚Äôt to say I don‚Äôt stress about other things such as work but it‚Äôs almost like I can control it now. Maybe it‚Äôs everything that I‚Äôve done which has got me here. I meditated, journaled, and focused on my hobbies as I love electric guitar and working out, and worked on relationships outside of dating. 

I really hope people tell themselves they can get through it when they reach a rut in life or they reach a point of hopelessness. It is really amazing when you reach the other side and you look back and think wow. Please don‚Äôt give up on yourself!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mhghx0/i_have_finally_reached_a_place_of_contentment/,2021-03-31 21:42:40,1,2,0

ChrisGnam,"After 7 years in school and 3 major changes, I finally landed my dream job!","This morning I officially accepted a Student Trainee (pathways) position at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center's Navigation and Mission Design branch, and I could not be happier.

Growing up, working in the space industry just seemed like such an impossible goal.  It seemed like dreaming of being a professional athlete.  It was something for other people but not for me.  I ended up entering undergrad as a bio major with only the vague goal of one day getting a job to make money, but nothing about it excited me.  I was always reading and following space events though!

In the summer of 2015, when New Horizon's flew past pluto, I  got off work early and sat in the parking watching the press conference on my phone.  It was just amazing to watch the scientists so happy about the success of the flyby and to see some of the images they had captured.  But then after awhile the press conference ended, and I quickly realized I wasn't actually a part of any of that.  I was just sitting in my car alone.  I was so overwhelmed by the thought that I could have left my life's passion just slip past me because I was too scared to pursue it, that I immediately called my university the next morning to transfer into the aerospace engineering program.  Unfortunately, they wouldn't let me as I did not meet the prereqs (specifically missing Calculus 1 any some other courses)

So I switched at first into Biomedical engineering, and then quickly into physics.  I spent 3 semesters in the physics department, completing a B.A. in math with a minor in physics, until I finally switched into aerospace engineering.  Once in the department I started looking for every opportunity I could find working in a number of labs just trying to get my foot in the door anywhere.  Eventually, I found my current mentor whose focus is in spacecraft navigation and I was immediately in love with the work, and agreed to do a PhD with him.

I worked under him for several years, and I even landed a few internships at NASA.  My second one was with the navigation team for OSIRIS-REx, and they brought me back for 3 internships with them, and even funded the first year of my PhD until I got a fellowship!  I continued to collaborate with them throughout the first two years of my PhD until last week, a pathways position opened up in their branch and I applied.  I was terrified, but the interview went well and today I officially received and accepted the offer!

I've never been so happy, it really is a dream come true.  In the past few years, I've even gotten a chance to meet some of the folks who work on the navigation team for New Horizons, and that part was what hit me the most.  The people who worked on the mission that really inspired me to genuinely pursue this path....  and they now felt more like colleagues than the near god-like figures they seemed like all those years ago.

I'm just incredibly happy at the moment and needed to share!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mhd4eo/after_7_years_in_school_and_3_major_changes_i/,2021-03-31 19:01:30,1,3,0

I have suffered from depression for my entire life. Got out of a terrible long term relationship about four years ago and spiralled down really hard. During covid a casual friend I‚Äôve known for a long time reached out and we started talking which turned to dating. I work nights so generally on my days off I‚Äôll play on my phone in bed while he sleeps. I went to the bathroom and when I came back he rolled over in his sleep and is currently cuddling with me. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt so happy and at peace with my life. For the first time in my life I can‚Äôt see anything wrong with my situation or myself.

LastConsul,My niece fell asleep on me for the first time and I fell asleep with her. It was beautiful,"So she is 3 years old and loves me to death, and I her. And yesterday I decided to visit my brother and her. The way her face lit up when she came around the corner and saw me is the cutest thing as she ran over yelling in joy and gave me a hug.

We spent all morning playing together and eventually she started rubbing her eyes and was about to take her afternoon nap. I sat on her bed with her in my lap.

""You tired?"", she nods her head. ""Yeah? You want to take a nap?"", she nods her head again. ""You know I luv you?"", she giggles and says ""Yes"". ""You luv me?"", she laughs again and says ""Yes"". I smile and reach forward and kiss her nose then her forehead and she giggles again. Finally she wraps her arms around me and falls onto my shoulder and I play with her hair gently to get her to fall asleep. By this point I'm pretty tired myself and once I see she's finally out, I put her on her pillow and decide I'm too tired to move and fall asleep next to her.

I wake up about an hour later and she's still asleep. But seeing her so blissfully asleep is utter perfection. Yes, I'm just an uncle, but I love her like nothing else. I don't ever plan on having kids of my own, because I see how much parents struggle to raise one kid and see how draining it can be, but it's moments like these that make it seem like it'll maybe be worth it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mfr381/my_niece_fell_asleep_on_me_for_the_first_time_and/,2021-03-29 14:44:45,1,5,0

I'm creating a rollerball essential oil fragrance and my goal is for general emotional support--something to comfort you, to offer soothing or a feeling of being tenderly cradled, if that makes sense. To allow you to feel tender and express emotions without feeling stressed by them or like they're gonna run away with you. Soothing and comforting I suppose is what I want to impart.

dribblekiwiiiiii,Left the house for the first time in 2 years.,"I went to the shop on my own today. No one asked me or pressured me into it, I wasn‚Äôt forced to go with someone else because my cupboards are empty and I haven‚Äôt eaten in a while. 

I woke up and went to the shop and for a little walk. All on my own. 
It‚Äôs the first time since December 2019 (when I was raped,) that I have left the house through choice alone. And I feel damn good about it. 
I woke up and decided to get ready and go for a walk, I used my last ¬£3 to pop into the shop on the way for milk and butter and give myself some purpose for being out and walking. 

I‚Äôm happy I did. I smiled at 2 people and passed another 5, a local worker said good morning and I said it back. I didn‚Äôt burst into tears and fall to the floor in a fit of anxiety. 

I know this is a very small/trivial thing but I have been terrified of leaving the house for fear of bumping into my rapist or his friends.
I haven‚Äôt left the house without my mother or partner for over a year, I haven‚Äôt gone into the village I am from and I even quit my job because of my fear of people. It‚Äôs become really severe, even getting post in my own apartment hallway triggers massive panic attacks, and I worry about even standing outside my front door in case he appears or something happens but I finally did it ! 
I can‚Äôt even explain how good I felt just being in control and taking a little bit of normalcy back for myself after so long. It‚Äôs like feeling you‚Äôre going to die every time you have to step foot past your door. And I overcame it today. 


I know this is not important or impressive but it personally felt really good, I don‚Äôt have anyone to tell so I thought a load of strangers would be good. I went from being the most outgoing person who would speak to anyone and was fearless to a complete hermit.
I hope today is a step in the right direction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mfb25e/left_the_house_for_the_first_time_in_2_years/,2021-03-28 22:00:40,2,8,0

With time it got worse and people started to take my vagina for granted and I was sexually abused quite a times. I still didn't stop being this person till I realised that I got one life and am I really respecting myself, my body and my sexuality. I gradually got into meditation and self and it all started from there. I started to love myself so much that I did not need any outside person to love me or complete me. But after so many years of making myself sexually available, I did not want to get indulged in any sexual activity with anyone, but then I again realized that I had the power of my own life in my own hands and no one can hurt me except my own self. So gradually I discovered tantra, then neo tantra.

gabgabs3,"I moved on after a toxic relationship and just got in my second ever relationship, I love him.","I just came here to bring some positivity. After a long term relationship that ended last October I have been all over the place (in a good way) trying to figure out who I was and what I wanted. I must admit it wasn't always the best, I had my downs here and there, I met new people and experienced a lot of new things. Regardless, this didnt show me anything, appart from wanting to explore more and not wanting to settle in a relationship for a long time. I found out I wasnt straight, I found out I needed my introvert side now and then between my extroverted phases, I needed my peace and quiet, and It kept me so focused onto my goals. I pushed every single unnecessary want for important ones. I moved into my own place. I bought my own car and a month away from getting my full license, I am incredibly supported at my job surrounded by the best and I mean BEST colleagues I could ever wish for. I have been setting up my life for success and gave up relationships for a while. Recently I met a guy and we clicked instantly, in a way Ive never clicked with anyone before. We are completely different, and yet so similiar. For a month I was not sure how to proceed, I feel like theres so much out there and yet this guy had me hooked. It took a lot of thinking about it and I ended up deciding to go for it. Its incredible how much happiness someone can bring you in such a short period of time compared to previous people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mf3ui8/i_moved_on_after_a_toxic_relationship_and_just/,2021-03-28 16:10:46,1,2,0

aylinchoreddit,A Love Letter for the Person Who Makes My Life Great; Kind of Happy,"Wow. We got this far. From being a dumb little kids chatting online about stupid drama to teenagers talking about life and reality drama. There is one reality I hate to have to accept. That is that I'm in love with you. You have a girlfriend, and I'm fine with that. I want you to be happy, I would never attempt to sabatoge your relationship. Hell, I would hate that. There's a higher chance of me getting hit by a train than doing that.. But however, I can't deny these hidden feelings inside of me that I depise. I grow so happy whenever I see a message from you, my cheeks turn red and my heart bursts with joy whenever we converse. 

You're one of the only people that can make me happy just by sending me a message. That's why I so frequently message you.. Of course, I'd never tell you this to your face, nope. It's pretty rare for me to hold on a crush for this long, but I can say that I am certain that I've fallen in love. Ugh, it's both a blissful feeling and a terrible one. Hopefully you'll never see this, you probably never will. 

This is a dumb little teenager crush, but I can't deny how hard I've fallen. It's embarrassing to write even though you'll never find this. I feel as if the cupid has struck me with 3 arrows instead of one (both like hellfire on your back but bliss). I know you think this little crush is adorable but I think it's also living hell. A part of my mind does want to be with you, romantically. But I do understand that will probably never become a reality, and I'm also fine with that. I don't even know what I'm saying at this point, I'm just saying that you, quite literally, drive me nuts but I'm also a rational person myself (credit to mom).

And I will say this, as much as I paint myself as the respectful non-jealous crush person, I will say. I do get jealous pretty frequently. As much as I will deny it, I am a very jealous and envious person. So, you could put the puzzle pieces together with that. 

Hugh, I don't have a lot more to say, other than. Yes, I've fallen in love with you. I know I act all embarrassed and shy whenever you bring up the crush, but now that you probably won't find this, I'm much more open now. Yes, I've fallen in love. Deep. Yes, I blush every-time you speak to me. Yes, I do think about you pretty frequently. Have I had this crush ever since the beginning of 2019? Yes. Yes, I do get insanely jealous. Will I admit it? No. 

I love you..both romantically and platonically :)

huntsman_459,"We moved today, and I'm just glad my daughter likes the new house, something me and my wife always wanted","So I've made numerous posts in the past about how I lost my wife a year ago and have been raising our daughter on my own. And a while ago, I made a post stating that I finally got a house, me and my wife's dream. It's a little two story family home but it has everything you could need, and my daughter gets to still go to the same school she does now.

I'll admit these past few weeks haven't been easy at all, mostly because the idea of us leaving the place my daughter grew up in is hard. I've slowly but surely trying to get her more into the idea of moving and she's kind of happy about it, but still. I promised her I'd give her something of her mom's too: a jewelry box with a ballerina inside and an old fashioned makeup/vanity table that my wife had as a kid. That got her in a much better mood. 

Our last night Friday was kind of forlorn, for obvious reasons. But she'd been taking lots of pictures of the place as something to remember it by. I made her favorite dinner for her also and let her stay up longer, but I also had a heart to heart with her about her mom. All I said was ""Mom will always be here (I pointed to her heart) and here (I pointed to her head). She never left us, she lives on through us and especially you. And plus you look just like her, like a spitting image"" and she didn't believe that last part but still smiled about it. Finally, I let her sleep in my bed if she wanted but she said no, yet she came in anyway in the middle of the night trying to be quiet as a mouse but I'm a rather light sleeper haha. 

So this morning, me and my brother and his wife, who my daughter absolutely adores, all had breakfast together before starting the packing. My brother borrowed a box truck from his work and we managed to get most of the big stuff like beds and couches all in in one trip thanks to the help of some other friends of his from work. Took us most of the day but we got everything settled and hooked up for the most part. 

But the last things we needed were the makeup table  and jewelery box, which were both at MIL's, her grandma. We said our hellos and my daughter gave her the biggest hug I'd ever seen from a kid her size, she's so full of love. Her eyes lit up seeing them in person, even though they were obviously in need of a good painting. I put some batteries in the jewelry box and let her play with and stare at it all the way home. It was the happiest I'd genuinely seen her in I don't know how long. 

And the rest of the evening was pretty chill. I asked her again what she thought of the place and she was still kind of adjusting to the whole thing but I could tell she was a little bit happier about it, even saying ""I think I'll like it"". There's still some small stuff to move in which we'll do tomorrow probably and I told her I'd bring her with to see the place one last time before handing over the keys back to the landlord. I'll admit I did get emotional a bit seeing us move all our stuff out, but just had to carry on. 

I also meant what I said about my wife and her living on through us. I'm not religious by any means nor spiritual, I just think she lives on through our memories and our character, who we are. And I know that wherever she is, she'd at least be proud of what our baby girl has become.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mes5wz/we_moved_today_and_im_just_glad_my_daughter_likes/,2021-03-28 02:03:13,1,4,0

Ledifen,Today I recieved a parcel that was in the wild for exactely 1 year,"I live in Belgium. Last year (End of February 2020), I went to the south of France for my internship. There were a few things I forgot from home and I was short on important medecine so I asked my mom if she could send me a package with them. 

She does. With the help of my father and sister, she sends me a lot more than what I had asked (tons of cute stuff because we all missed each other). **She send it on the 17th of March 2020.** 

I never received it. Unfotunately, with Covid19, there was a lot of problems and nop matter how hard I try, no one would tell me where my parcel was. I eventually came back to Belgium thinking *we'll never see the package again*. The people working for the post basically told us that. That meant a lot of trinket with tons of emotional value were lost forever.

**BUT NO! Today, on the 17th of March 2021, guess what came in with the mailman? You guessed it : My parcel.** I was excited like a kid in front of Christmass presents. I opened it and **pretty much everything is in good shape**. A frame got a little roughed up, but nothing a little glue couldn't solve. A few items of clothing need a wash (smelly \^\^) but that about it.

huntsman_459,I did what my wife always wanted to and am in the final steps of getting our first house,"A two story single-family home in the suburbs that will still allow our daughter to go to the same school she does now and is honestly just perfect in every way. My wife passed away a year ago and we always dreamt of owning a house, even if it was just the three of us. I honestly can't even express how happy this whole situation makes me.

I took a tour of it a few months ago with my daughter and I myself fell in love with it immediately. It has just about everything we could ever need from a space perspective and also has spare bedrooms that I especially want to have a home office in one. It's nothing too big, but I know my wife would be more than satisfied if she could see it.

Though, obviously, my girl was a little less than thrilled about the prospect of moving at first for one obvious reason: she's never moved before. The apartment we're at now is all she's ever known. Though I got some advice from both my family and others on this site about how to possibly get her more on board with wanting to move, since her mom's passing was still on her mind. So I had an idea and am going to not only let her paint and decorate her room however she wants, I'm also going to give her some things that belonged to her mom. One is an old fashioned makeup mirror (or whatever it's technically called) that she had when she was growing up, and the other is a jewelry box with a ballerina in it that was actually my wife's grandmother's. I showed both of them to her and immediately I saw a change in her. I also told her I'd let her paint both of them on her own if she wants.

Home inspection has already been done and nothing noteworthy to affect the sale was found since the owners had been taking exceptional care of it since they moved in, even adding on to it in a few places. My landlord also knows about the move and the timing was extremely important since my lease ends this month, and he's basically gonna give me a month or so to move everything out once it's up.

But honestly, the thing that made this all easier is my girl. Ever since I told her about her getting my wife's mirror and jewelry box, she's been significantly more into the prospective move. She's been a little forlorn though, just knowing how many memories she's had here. And it's shaken me up a bit too. This is the same place we brought her home from the hospital to when she was born, where almost all of her birthdays have been and so much more.

Well... she has no idea... but I booked my son and I tickets to visit her next month. I'm so excited I could cry! She has a local friend that's helping, making sure she doesn't plan anything.

TheGothamEmpire,Finding My Passion through unexpected means.,"It always makes me wonder why the YouTube Algorithm decided to recommend me a movie clip from Son of Batman almost three years ago now. I have never watched a single comic-related video up until that point. 

Though, looking back at my past, there‚Äôs always been a pull towards it. Whenever someone would ask, ‚ÄúBatman or Superman?‚Äù I would automatically pick Batman without knowing a single thing about him. And whenever we would go to Party City, I would always put on a Batman mask.

Could it have been destiny? Fate? Whatever it was, I‚Äôm sure glad I decided to give in and watch it. It introduced me to a whole new world of art and entertainment. I feel that it changed my life for the better. It got me out of the habit of drawing only cats, I started improving faster, I became more confident, and I even started working on my own Batman comic. 

Three years later... I have a Batman tattoo, a bunch of merchandise, art, and I feel like I finally figured out what I was meant to do in life. My dream. My passion.

Thank you to whatever happened that fateful day. August 4th, 2018. The day I started discovering myself.

AnchoredEnclosure,"My daughter said ""I love you too"" to me for the first time since me and my wife divorced","We love our daughter (she's 13 btw), we just don't love each other. That's honestly the best way to describe the relationship at this point. We look at each other and we know there's just nothing there anymore, no deep, yearning love like when we first met. But no hostility either. We see each other as good friends who genuinely care about each other, but leave it at that. Needless to say the divorce was amicable. We each had our own attorneys for representation's sake, but the filing was fairly straightforward and our visitation agreements between our daughter was agreed upon.

I have to thank my (now ex) wife for making it significantly easier for our daughter to comprehend and make peace with. She really was able to get through to her much easier than I was. She made it clear that none of it was her fault, not in the slightest, and that we both loved her equally. The hardest thing was just us not being together. She couldn't quite wrap her head around that, even though her ears had to listen to some of the more intense arguments we had between me and my wife.

Anyway, getting back on track, we had just finished dinner together and my daughter was still on that tipping point: being a little withdrawn since the separation, but not fully shutting me out either. She went to her room and I was doing dishes and I hear her screaming over the phone at someone, the angriest I've ever seen her. I go to her door but then stop myself and just think ""Let her get it out"", and so I just stand there listening to her call someone a ""fu--ing cu-t"", ""bi-ch"", you name it, and I'm just like ""Woo man, hate to be on the other end of that call"". Eventually things go quiet and I slowly open the door. She immediately tells me to fuck off but I can tell she doesn't mean it, she's just angry at the world.

So I sit down next to her and just very calmly ask her what happened. Here's the jist: Some girl from school that she was in a group chat with said that her mom must be happy to be out of the house and is probably already with another guy because I supposedly wasn't keeping her (my wife) ""satisfied"" enough, and also that they'd probably still be together if it wasn't for her (my daughter). Yes, another 13 year old kid said that, hand to God. And then my daughter basically gave the ""You have no idea what you're talking about"" rebuttal and layed into her, defending me in some way. There's more to it but that's essentially what went down, some girl tried being a troll for shits and giggles.

As she's going into more detail, she's on the verge of tears and I just hold her hand and scoot closer to her, telling her that none of it is true and that she shouldn't listen to her. Even though she's nodding her head in agreement, she kicks her nightstand out of anger and knocks a glass over and it shatters and she screams ""Fuck"" at the top of her lungs. This sends her over and I take the opportunity and just hold her tight against my chest as she bawls her eyes out, screaming and crying at the same time. After she wraps her arms around me, all I can think to do is let her carry on, just softly repeating ""It's okay baby, I'm here"" and ""It's gonna be okay baby. It's gonna be okay"" and I nearly start crying just seeing her like this.

She starts coughing from crying and yelling so much and I just rub her back and kiss the top of her head over and over to help her calm down. She eventually gets to a point where she isn't crying anymore and is just staring out into the hallway. I let the silence just sit there for a few moments before I get her to look at me and stare directly into her eyes and say ""I love you sweetie. You're gonna be okay"" and kiss her forehead before she says ""I love you too"" and I smile warmly but she doesn't smile back, yet I still just hold her close and we sit in silence.

I know this was probably a build-up from all her anger and rage she was holding in since the separation, and I don't blame her for being that way at all. After she finally was really calm, I asked her if there was anything she wanted to talk about but she said no. I reminded her that she can talk to me about anything and we just kind of left it at that.

I know we have a lot to work through, but I'm confident she'll come to terms with the whole thing one day. And if she wants to do something like therapy to help her, I'll be there for her 100%.

I struggle a lot with my mental health and it made me so inexplicably happy. So we passed it on to the person behind us. We were stuck at the stop sign after the drive thru so I turned around to see the guy stop mid handing the barista his card and then to look at me in surprise. He pulled down his mask to smile and wave and I waved back. (My housemate jokes that I should‚Äôve gotten his number). And then I watched him pull his mask back up and give her his card anyways. I‚Äôm not sure how many people it passed through, but thank you to whoever started it and to all of those who passed it on. Remember to be kind, it really can make someone smile on a bad day.

honest_scenario,My niece that I helped raise visited me for the first time since starting college!,"So long story short I helped raise my niece after her dad (my older brother) walked out on her and her mom when she was 12. I originally was hesitant about doing it because I was still grieving the loss of my wife years earlier, something I still haven't fully moved on from of course. Me helping raise her were honestly the happiest years of my life. I'm confident in saying she's the daughter I never had and I'm the dad she deserved and needed. I was there for her at her lowest and highest. And letting her go to start college was one of the hardest days in a long time, but I knew she'd be okay. 

We'd been keeping in contact as regularly as possible, texting a couple times a week. And in her absence, I got myself a dog to help with I guess my loneliness, as sad as that sounds (his name's Bullet, btw). He's a Labrador Retriever mix and one of his favorite things is hide and seek. He's as trained as can be and rarely barks at other dogs or people when he's home alone. And obviously coming home to him running up to me never fails to put a smile on my face. 

Anyway, my niece messaged me saying she had a long weekend due to having just finished midterm exams and was going to come over to my place to visit after she saw her mom first (who also was equally there for her, btw). So I'm waiting and waiting and then I hear a car door close in my driveway. I go out and, no surprise, it's her. And the biggest smile imaginable comes across both of our faces as I walk over and we hug each other. And it wasn't one of those hugs you give casually to your parents when you're going somewhere or when you see a good close friend. This was one where we held each other tight, long and didn't say anything. And after I kissed the top of her head hard, the first words I said were ""How's school been, baby?"". 

And she laughs and we head inside. The even bigger surprise was that she hadn't even gone to her mom's yet, she came to see me first. This just melted me. I also brought my dog in from the backyard to see her and she immediately fell in love with him. I remember he kept looking at me like ""Who is this?"" and the more I stood next to her petting him the more comfortable he got. 

We then just sat and talked about school and how everything was going (she's going for Education and wants to teach K-8). Basically, she's made some new friends, is in a club for her major and loves most of her classes. 

My life was obviously less exciting haha, only really telling her I'd been seeing other family members, working from home more, started doing some home renovations, all that. And I actually did manage to reconnect with someone I went to high school with and we met up for the first time a couple weeks ago. 

I also showed her something I never had before. It was a photo of me and my wife at the hospital on the day of my niece's birth, and I let her keep it. Rest of the day we spent with her mom and other family and went out to eat together, watched a movie and other cool and exciting stuff. I'm planning on taking her shooting tomorrow, one of her favorite pastimes. Just her being in my presence makes everything better.

My 13yr old baby very recently got medicated for anxiety. At her follow-up today the very first thing she told them was ""I am proud of my progress because now I can voice characters in my dad's children's shows and not care what people think!!"" I am so very proud of my baby! This is the episode she was talking about. She plays the pink dog with big eyes (on the table) and also a yellow labrador on the chair!

White_Notepad,"As of today, I'm officially one year sober. And I'll never forget what inspired me to quit in the first place","I was basically a steady drinker in my late 20's, usually getting drunk at least a few times a week and starting off my morning with a beer or mimosa even if I was feeling fancy. And the kicker? I had a kid. My six year old daughter. And my wife who suffered through all of my bullshit. I was a monster with a bottle in his hand, never abusive or mean to them, but quickly going down a health path I was sure I couldn't recover from. 

And one Saturday morning, I woke up with a hangover like nothing I had ever felt. It was like someone had a sledgehammer and was beating me senseless over the head. Blurry vision, hardly able to stand, and I legitimately, truly thought that the solution was to drink more. So I poured myself a whiskey and threw it back. And I remember feeling this very brief sense of ""Huh, I guess it passed"" before something from my stomach shot up to the top like a volcano and I was basically projectile vomiting all over the kitchen walls, on the counter and in the sink. 

I remember that while my face was buried in the sink now, I found the strength to stand up and collect myself a bit, feeling a bit better and just looking around and seeing the volume of my destruction. ""Wait, *I* did that?"" was immediately what went through my head. But that vomiting wasn't what really made me want to change. It was my daughter having to come out and see it. Yep, she came out of her room and just stood there looking at me and all that vomit. 

And I remember the first thing she said was ""Are you sick, dad?"". And I reassured her that I was okay and that I just had an accident and politely told her to go back to her room for a little while while I cleaned up, and she just nodded and walked away. As soon as she closed her door I immediately burst into tears crying my eyes out on the floor, the stink of my puke really starting to become more apparent. 

I eventually collected myself and scrubbed the whole area down like it was a crime scene. That was the moment I decided to stop. Not my vomiting or me crying, but seeing her standing there just staring in complete confusion and worry. So I also threw out all the bottles and cans that day as well. Anything that wasn't hand sanitizer that contained alcohol was going in the bin. And it stayed there. 

Now it's a year later and, if I'm being honest, I don't feel that different. I mean I'm glad I stopped drinking and that I have my family still with me, but I don't feel any different from a personality perspective. I'm still the same sarcastic and upstanding guy I was before who also loves deadpan humor and can name you 10 of my favorite bands of all time. Nothing's changed, yet everything has at the same time also.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/m485n5/as_of_today_im_officially_one_year_sober_and_ill/,2021-03-13 15:12:51,1,5,0

little_mealmaid,I found out my dissertation/thesis grade yesterday,"I was walking down the corridor at work with a colleague and we got to talking about our degrees (we both study psychology) and I mentioned that it could be any day now that my bachelor‚Äôs dissertation/thesis grade would show up. 

And I said that I check daily and I hadn‚Äòt today, so I whipped out my phone to take a look, not really expecting it to be there but as I was talking to her and scrolling down the page there it was!

I literally stopped mid sentence and I almost started crying. I got a 1,3 (that‚Äòs a first class in the UK and a 3.7 GPA in the US)!

After a failed degree a couple years ago it was such a weight lifted off of my shoulders to have handed the dissertation/thesis in, but to receive this grade was so much more than I have hoped for.
