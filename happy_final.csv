runthereszombies,"Got a really nice compliment about my OSCE assessment today, and it made me happier than I've felt since starting med school","Im a medical student in the US. At the end of the year, every US med student has to complete a several hours long assessment called an OSCE, where you conduct 5 or 6 doctors appointments with a variety of people who have a variety of complaints.  The patients are trained actors.  Anything from a stomach ache to a stroke, and you dont know what it is until you walk into the exam room.  Our OSCEs are running this month and I did mine yesterday.  I didnt know how to feel about it because I've been having a lot of self doubt about my ability to do this thing.  Today, I was waiting to go into a class when I heard my name being called from behind me.  I turned around and the director of the program that trains the actors approached me to compliment me on the OSCE I had with her the day before.

LittleTreeGirl,I made a shirt for myself based on counseling! :) Feeling happy/proud so I wanted to share!,"Hi everyone! I hope you are all happy and healthy - or working towards it :) 

I just got a Cricut and wanted to try making a shirt so this is my first attempt. (I'll explain it first)

I really struggle with self-confidence - I have such a hard time thinking that I am pretty enough, or smart enough, or good enough for anything- but my counselor has really been helping me feel like I am a decent person who deserves to be happy! So I was telling him the other day how grateful I am that he's planting the seeds that I am good enough and that I deserve to be happy. But - I realized that wasn't what I meant. 

For years professors have told me I'm smart, or that I'm doing a good job. Strangers and friends compliment my appearance or my personality. But those seeds never take root. Any seeds that have been planted haven't been able to grow because my garden is just too dry and uncared for. So I think it's more accurate to say my counselor is watering my garden! :-p He is/ he's helping me make my garden/mind a place where the old and new seeds can take root and grow! :) and I liked that analogy for all of counseling really. Counselors help us make our mind into a healthier place so we can grow confidence, happiness, and everything else we need! :) 

So I made a shirt to remind me to keep working on watering my garden and making my mind a place that fosters all the good I want in my life :) 

Here it is :) I know it's not much but it's the first thing I've drawn, designed, or made into a shirt so it's still pretty cool lol

BicAsschecks69,Stop Self-pity and beginn with Self-help,"Hello everyone,

I hope this gets to the people that also like me, have the urge of helping others and to find deep-meaning within it, to acknowledge that life can be difficult but also that something can be done about it when we exchange each other's expierences and start the process of self help.

I would love to help anybody in need of it or just to talk about interesting topics.

For this cause I made a Discord server, where I hope someday a lot of people will take part in, especially in these times of economic stagnation and Covid( I know I can't stand this word either).

So let's do something about it and make the best out of the Situation, I am open for suggestions and discussions about anything. Sometimes the best self-help maybe is just talking and opening up, so here's the discord: https://discord.gg/3FqWB5gA",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mmrb01/stop_selfpity_and_beginn_with_selfhelp/,2021-04-08 13:03:07,1,1,0

OhYeahThat,My husband can now watch sports and it makes me so happy,"Times have been tight in the past for us and we made the choice not to pay for TV services in order to be able to afford other things.  My husband loves sports.  We were able to get the major networks over the air with our antenna.  In spite of that, many times he missed games and events that were only available through cable or otherwise.  He never once complained but it bothered me because I know how much he loves watching games.

Things have improved for us and this year we made the decision to pay for a basic streaming package. This allowed my husband to watch all of March Madness.  He had so much fun and it just makes me so happy to see him enjoying the thing he loves.  Now he turns on sports in the evening and even though I really couldn't care less about them, I love how happy it makes him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mm273h/my_husband_can_now_watch_sports_and_it_makes_me/,2021-04-07 13:34:37,1,5,0
Val_Squidson,"I have awesome college “sisters” and I’m so lucky to have them in my life, especially now","College is hard and that’s a fact :’D I had a really hard time making friends this year due to Covid and such and I spent a lot of time in my room. One day I ran into an acquaintance—we’ll call her Mari—who I met through a club. She asked me if I was going to head to lunch, I said yes, and we ate together. She introduced me to all of her friends, and we had a blast.

I started hanging out with Mari a lot more after that day. I had just fallen out with my old friend group so Mari took me in as her “little sister.” She was really sweet, and I got a lot closer with her, her roommate Cali, and another friend Nation. We spent a lot of time together this semester, eating almost every meal together and hanging out almost every night. Cali and Nation have also adopted me as a “little sister.”

Things at college have been really tense. I don’t want to accidentally turn this into a “silver lining” post so I won’t go into details. But for the whole semester I’ve been having really bad nightmares and hallucinations. I also can never sleep the whole night because my dorm room is close to the front door and people scream like chimpanzees walking in. So Mari and Cali offered to clean up the third bed and let me sleep in their room. I’ve been there for many days since they first offered and it’s helped a lot.

Tonight I had a panic attack. I didn’t want to call my parents or my therapist for whatever reason (ig because I’m tired of depending on them so much?) so I called Mari. She came right over to my room and spent probably an hour with me just hugging me and comforting me as I cried in her arms. She spent another half hour listening to me complain about life and explain what in the world is running through my head. I cried about how I was so scared about losing her and stressing her out and she was so reassuring. Whenever I was highly stressed, my previous friends would say they would always be there for me (spoiler alert: they weren’t). Mari said that as well, but she also added that I deserved friends who could care for me like this at the bare minimum. She said some other comforting things as well which distracted me from the fear of broken promises. And on top of that, she invited me over to her room again so I could focus better on homework and sleep better.

I love these girls so much ;w; I hope I don’t lose them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mltkib/i_have_awesome_college_sisters_and_im_so_lucky_to/,2021-04-07 03:49:41,1,4,0

Duke581,I succeded in accomplishing my body goals in a year with a plot twist.,"So, a year ago I was unsatisfied with my body. I have been overweight for almost my entire life and also unsatisfied with my own height. I was very stressed a year ago and I tried everything to calm myself. Then I started cycling for an hour a day. I live in a countryside and I enjoyed nature a lot. It made me calmed down. I also made some differences to my diet, mostly kicking out fast food. I genuenly started to feel happier. I lost about 40 pounds due to my diet change and cycling. But I was still unsatisfied with my height. During last few months, I noticed that I gained some weight, but I still haven't got any bally fat or muscle mass. Yesterday my gf (who was taller than me) asked me if I grew in height. Then I realised that somehow I became as tall as her. I thought it was because of terrain outside or shoes, but I measured myself today. I grew 2 inches since last year. Thing is, that I thought I wouldn't grow anymore (since I am almost 20 years old). I am so happy, and I wanted to share this with someone!

subbratkinky,My mother in law compared me to Martha Stuart,"Let me give some background I love hosting. I love bringing joy to people. I also love being around friends and not having to leave my home. My MIL (mother in law) normally hosts events, but I hosted Easter with my hubs family yesterday. My MIL is also extremely OCD and a germaphobe. We have a good relationship though (we are very different people though.. her idea of camping is staying in a fully furnished cabin while mine is in a hammock under the stars. She likes glam/modern I like rustic..think chip and Joanne gains.. I live on a small farm while she freaks out at the thought of poop). 

We were all sitting around and idk how it came up but I said I'd like to turn the farm into a wedding venue one day and I even came up with a name ""Oak Grove Farms"" or ""the original OG"" cue chuckles. Apparently MIL didn't know what OG meant so my SIL explained it to her. MIL then said ""oh my goodness, you are not a gangster if anything you're more like Martha Stuart."" 

Y'all I don't achieve to be like Martha Stuart, but my MIL is one of the hardest people to please when it comes to hosting and that was seriously the best compliment she could have ever given me. Of course we then went into the conversation that Martha Stuart and snoop dog are friends and only one of them is a convicted felon but hey.

Lololucky,Fully moved into my new place and it feels like I’m on vacation every day!,"My s/o and I were stuck in an apartment we hated for the past 3+ years. Overpaying for a 1 bedroom apartment with no w/d hookups, a sad excuse for a kitchen, everything always broken down, and in general a place where we faced a lot of hardship and strain on our relationship. 

Just moved a week ago and have so much more space now, a washer and dryer, a beautiful big back porch, and a real kitchen that we can both be in at the same time.

TheGirlWithTheLove,Something amazing happened to me at work yesterday.,"I work at a grocery store, and I am autistic. The following story happened to me during the last half hour of my shift.

My usual task at work is to sweep the store. When I got to the deli department, a customer asked me where the hot soup is. I showed her where it is. She told me that she saw a man outside the building who may be homeless, and wanted to give him something warm to eat. I told her, “Wow, that’s really nice of you to do that!” We were both struggling to get the lids apart, and I told her that I think I was having trouble with it because my weak right hand. She asked why it’s weak. I asked if she’d have a problem if I got too personal, and she said that it’s fine. I told her that I was born prematurely, and besides having autism, I had a brain aneurysm that made the right side of my body weak. She apologized out of sympathy, but I just told her, “Don’t apologize! I lived with it my whole life. It makes me have something that not many people have.”

After getting the soup, she tells me that she needs to buy a few more things. I tell her that I can help her look for them. While we were walking, I asked if she’s been to the store before. She said that she hasn’t been there in a few years. She also opened up to me about how she moved back to town with her dad because she’s been struggling with mental issues. I could tell that she was comfortable enough to tell me that. And I totally understand that sometimes, customers just need someone to listen to them. I really appreciated that. She talked to me like I was an old friend of hers. At one point, she even offered to buy me a lunch, but I told her that my shift was almost over, so I didn’t need anything. But I let her know that I really appreciated her offering.

By the time I walked to to a register to check out, my shift was over, and I still needed to complete the store sweep, but I didn’t care. She thanked me for helping her. What she told me next really surprised me. She said that she would love to see me again, and go out for lunch or something. I told her that that would be awesome, as pretty much all of my friends live out of state. I have a set work schedule, so I told her which days I work. I told her that I had a stressful day (everyone getting ready for Easter), and she made my day so much better. She gave me a whole bunch of hugs, introduced herself to me, and told me she’d see me later. I ended up making a new friend. Emily, if you happen to read this, thank you for being so kind. You have a good heart, and you are a beautiful person. I hope this will be the start to a great friendship.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mhzfds/something_amazing_happened_to_me_at_work_yesterday/,2021-04-01 16:46:23,1,5,0

kentuckychicken1987,Feeling happy for the first time in a while,"Today seems like the first really good day in a long time, and shit seems to be falling back into place. Here’s why:

1. A few days ago I was feeling suicidal and pretty much posted a suicide note saying goodbye to the world, and yesterday a good friend who I didn’t think I’d hear from again saw it and urged me not to commit suicide, it honestly got me thinking about why it’s worth it to live. 

2. For the last few days my left ear has been plugged up and this morning I went to my doctor’s office and he unplugged it, he says I can come back for the same thing if it happens again which will save me the week of agony I had the last time this happened this past January. 

3. I heard lots of songs I genuinely like on the radio in the car today, including Alive by Pearl Jam (must’ve been a message from up above)

4. My favourite flavour of Pepsi, Pepsi Throwback (I’m a Coke diehard) is back on the shelves where I live, it was an unexpected surprise and a good one at that, been waiting a while to taste the real sugar lol. 

5. It’s actually very bright and sunny where I live, weather’s been absolute shit lately so this is really badly needed right now.

I dunno what this is, did God see how I was feeling the lowest of low and decide to help me out? What the fuck? I was feeling ready to end it all and now this... god damn I guess it’s worth it to live isn’t it?

E_J_C20,I have finally reached a place of contentment with what I have in life and have grown emotionally strong!,"
It’s taken a lot of time to reach this point. I’ve got no idea how I really came to this point of contentment and I really just want to write about it as I’m feeling good even if no one reads it. I’ve always been someone who can get through anything but the last year was a crazy one. 

I 22(f) lost my grandma to covid, who I spent the last week of her life looking after her and listening out to her at night if she fell off the bed it was really heartbreaking. 

I broke up with my bf of 3 years as I was miserable with him as he had such a negative outlook on life. It was just tough as I felt a lot of guilt. 

Lost my cousin to mental health issues, she was admitted to hospital and haven’t seen her since. She was like my sister. 

Dated a guy whom I thought was amazing, the first guy to introduce me to his family, actually take me out on dates. Who then turned out to be emotionally abusive. 

This triggered a traumatic event in my life to which I held this event for 10 years without telling anyone. I decided to go to therapy which was the best decision I have made. 

I have been dating around, been ghosted, all the crappy stuff. But by the third date something switched in me. I’m really happy even when things don’t work out. I’ve grown this confidence in myself that I’m good with and without someone. I’ve grown strong in all sorts of way, have focused so much on my friendships that I love all the friends I have and tell them I’m grateful for all of them, focused on my family that I do things now such as make a massive dinner like curry night out of pure joy (never used to do this) and this makes My parents really happy after a long day at work. all of this has contributed to just me being happy with what I have currently. 

Just things are great. And this isn’t to say I don’t stress about other things such as work but it’s almost like I can control it now. Maybe it’s everything that I’ve done which has got me here. I meditated, journaled, and focused on my hobbies as I love electric guitar and working out, and worked on relationships outside of dating. 

I really hope people tell themselves they can get through it when they reach a rut in life or they reach a point of hopelessness. It is really amazing when you reach the other side and you look back and think wow. Please don’t give up on yourself!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mhghx0/i_have_finally_reached_a_place_of_contentment/,2021-03-31 21:42:40,1,2,0

ChrisGnam,"After 7 years in school and 3 major changes, I finally landed my dream job!","This morning I officially accepted a Student Trainee (pathways) position at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center's Navigation and Mission Design branch, and I could not be happier.

Growing up, working in the space industry just seemed like such an impossible goal.  It seemed like dreaming of being a professional athlete.  It was something for other people but not for me.  I ended up entering undergrad as a bio major with only the vague goal of one day getting a job to make money, but nothing about it excited me.  I was always reading and following space events though!

In the summer of 2015, when New Horizon's flew past pluto, I  got off work early and sat in the parking watching the press conference on my phone.  It was just amazing to watch the scientists so happy about the success of the flyby and to see some of the images they had captured.  But then after awhile the press conference ended, and I quickly realized I wasn't actually a part of any of that.  I was just sitting in my car alone.  I was so overwhelmed by the thought that I could have left my life's passion just slip past me because I was too scared to pursue it, that I immediately called my university the next morning to transfer into the aerospace engineering program.  Unfortunately, they wouldn't let me as I did not meet the prereqs (specifically missing Calculus 1 any some other courses)

So I switched at first into Biomedical engineering, and then quickly into physics.  I spent 3 semesters in the physics department, completing a B.A. in math with a minor in physics, until I finally switched into aerospace engineering.  Once in the department I started looking for every opportunity I could find working in a number of labs just trying to get my foot in the door anywhere.  Eventually, I found my current mentor whose focus is in spacecraft navigation and I was immediately in love with the work, and agreed to do a PhD with him.

I worked under him for several years, and I even landed a few internships at NASA.  My second one was with the navigation team for OSIRIS-REx, and they brought me back for 3 internships with them, and even funded the first year of my PhD until I got a fellowship!  I continued to collaborate with them throughout the first two years of my PhD until last week, a pathways position opened up in their branch and I applied.  I was terrified, but the interview went well and today I officially received and accepted the offer!

I've never been so happy, it really is a dream come true.  In the past few years, I've even gotten a chance to meet some of the folks who work on the navigation team for New Horizons, and that part was what hit me the most.  The people who worked on the mission that really inspired me to genuinely pursue this path....  and they now felt more like colleagues than the near god-like figures they seemed like all those years ago.

I have suffered from depression for my entire life. Got out of a terrible long term relationship about four years ago and spiralled down really hard. During covid a casual friend I’ve known for a long time reached out and we started talking which turned to dating. I work nights so generally on my days off I’ll play on my phone in bed while he sleeps. I went to the bathroom and when I came back he rolled over in his sleep and is currently cuddling with me. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so happy and at peace with my life. For the first time in my life I can’t see anything wrong with my situation or myself.

LastConsul,My niece fell asleep on me for the first time and I fell asleep with her. It was beautiful,"So she is 3 years old and loves me to death, and I her. And yesterday I decided to visit my brother and her. The way her face lit up when she came around the corner and saw me is the cutest thing as she ran over yelling in joy and gave me a hug.

We spent all morning playing together and eventually she started rubbing her eyes and was about to take her afternoon nap. I sat on her bed with her in my lap.

""You tired?"", she nods her head. ""Yeah? You want to take a nap?"", she nods her head again. ""You know I luv you?"", she giggles and says ""Yes"". ""You luv me?"", she laughs again and says ""Yes"". I smile and reach forward and kiss her nose then her forehead and she giggles again. Finally she wraps her arms around me and falls onto my shoulder and I play with her hair gently to get her to fall asleep. By this point I'm pretty tired myself and once I see she's finally out, I put her on her pillow and decide I'm too tired to move and fall asleep next to her.

I wake up about an hour later and she's still asleep. But seeing her so blissfully asleep is utter perfection. Yes, I'm just an uncle, but I love her like nothing else. I don't ever plan on having kids of my own, because I see how much parents struggle to raise one kid and see how draining it can be, but it's moments like these that make it seem like it'll maybe be worth it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mfr381/my_niece_fell_asleep_on_me_for_the_first_time_and/,2021-03-29 14:44:45,1,5,0

To allow you to feel tender and express emotions without feeling stressed by them or like they're gonna run away with you. Soothing and comforting I suppose is what I want to impart.

dribblekiwiiiiii,Left the house for the first time in 2 years.,"I went to the shop on my own today. No one asked me or pressured me into it, I wasn’t forced to go with someone else because my cupboards are empty and I haven’t eaten in a while. 

I woke up and went to the shop and for a little walk. All on my own. 
It’s the first time since December 2019 (when I was raped,) that I have left the house through choice alone. And I feel damn good about it. 
I woke up and decided to get ready and go for a walk, I used my last £3 to pop into the shop on the way for milk and butter and give myself some purpose for being out and walking. 

I’m happy I did. I smiled at 2 people and passed another 5, a local worker said good morning and I said it back. I didn’t burst into tears and fall to the floor in a fit of anxiety. 

I know this is a very small/trivial thing but I have been terrified of leaving the house for fear of bumping into my rapist or his friends.
I haven’t left the house without my mother or partner for over a year, I haven’t gone into the village I am from and I even quit my job because of my fear of people. It’s become really severe, even getting post in my own apartment hallway triggers massive panic attacks, and I worry about even standing outside my front door in case he appears or something happens but I finally did it ! 
I can’t even explain how good I felt just being in control and taking a little bit of normalcy back for myself after so long. It’s like feeling you’re going to die every time you have to step foot past your door. And I overcame it today. 


I know this is not important or impressive but it personally felt really good, I don’t have anyone to tell so I thought a load of strangers would be good. I went from being the most outgoing person who would speak to anyone and was fearless to a complete hermit.
I hope today is a step in the right direction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mfb25e/left_the_house_for_the_first_time_in_2_years/,2021-03-28 22:00:40,2,8,0
Riaas_xo,I have the power of my own life in my own hands and no one can hurt me except my own self," So yea, there was a time when I used to make myself very ""sexually available"" to people(men) cause I thought that the way I can get love from them. With time it got worse and people started to take my vagina for granted and I was sexually abused quite a times. I still didn't stop being this person till I realised that I got one life and am I really respecting myself, my body and my sexuality. I gradually got into meditation and self and it all started from there. I started to love myself so much that I did not need any outside person to love me or complete me. But after so many years of making myself sexually available, I did not want to get indulged in any sexual activity with anyone, but then I again realized that I had the power of my own life in my own hands and no one can hurt me except my own self. So gradually I discovered tantra, then neo tantra. I understood how sex is not just pleasure but energy and I began to worship my body and indulge in sexuality but this time in a more respectful, conscious, and spiritual manner.

Regardless, this didnt show me anything, appart from wanting to explore more and not wanting to settle in a relationship for a long time.

aylinchoreddit,A Love Letter for the Person Who Makes My Life Great; Kind of Happy,"Wow. We got this far. From being a dumb little kids chatting online about stupid drama to teenagers talking about life and reality drama. There is one reality I hate to have to accept. That is that I'm in love with you. You have a girlfriend, and I'm fine with that. I want you to be happy, I would never attempt to sabatoge your relationship. Hell, I would hate that. There's a higher chance of me getting hit by a train than doing that.. But however, I can't deny these hidden feelings inside of me that I depise. I grow so happy whenever I see a message from you, my cheeks turn red and my heart bursts with joy whenever we converse. 

You're one of the only people that can make me happy just by sending me a message. That's why I so frequently message you.. Of course, I'd never tell you this to your face, nope. It's pretty rare for me to hold on a crush for this long, but I can say that I am certain that I've fallen in love. Ugh, it's both a blissful feeling and a terrible one. Hopefully you'll never see this, you probably never will. 

This is a dumb little teenager crush, but I can't deny how hard I've fallen. It's embarrassing to write even though you'll never find this. I feel as if the cupid has struck me with 3 arrows instead of one (both like hellfire on your back but bliss). I know you think this little crush is adorable but I think it's also living hell. A part of my mind does want to be with you, romantically. But I do understand that will probably never become a reality, and I'm also fine with that. I don't even know what I'm saying at this point, I'm just saying that you, quite literally, drive me nuts but I'm also a rational person myself (credit to mom).

And I will say this, as much as I paint myself as the respectful non-jealous crush person, I will say. I do get jealous pretty frequently. As much as I will deny it, I am a very jealous and envious person. So, you could put the puzzle pieces together with that. 

Hugh, I don't have a lot more to say, other than. Yes, I've fallen in love with you. I know I act all embarrassed and shy whenever you bring up the crush, but now that you probably won't find this, I'm much more open now. Yes, I've fallen in love. Deep. Yes, I blush every-time you speak to me. Yes, I do think about you pretty frequently. Have I had this crush ever since the beginning of 2019? Yes. Yes, I do get insanely jealous. Will I admit it? No. 

I love you..both romantically and platonically :)

huntsman_459,"We moved today, and I'm just glad my daughter likes the new house, something me and my wife always wanted","So I've made numerous posts in the past about how I lost my wife a year ago and have been raising our daughter on my own. And a while ago, I made a post stating that I finally got a house, me and my wife's dream. It's a little two story family home but it has everything you could need, and my daughter gets to still go to the same school she does now.

I'll admit these past few weeks haven't been easy at all, mostly because the idea of us leaving the place my daughter grew up in is hard. I've slowly but surely trying to get her more into the idea of moving and she's kind of happy about it, but still. I promised her I'd give her something of her mom's too: a jewelry box with a ballerina inside and an old fashioned makeup/vanity table that my wife had as a kid. That got her in a much better mood. 

Our last night Friday was kind of forlorn, for obvious reasons. But she'd been taking lots of pictures of the place as something to remember it by. I made her favorite dinner for her also and let her stay up longer, but I also had a heart to heart with her about her mom. All I said was ""Mom will always be here (I pointed to her heart) and here (I pointed to her head). She never left us, she lives on through us and especially you. And plus you look just like her, like a spitting image"" and she didn't believe that last part but still smiled about it. Finally, I let her sleep in my bed if she wanted but she said no, yet she came in anyway in the middle of the night trying to be quiet as a mouse but I'm a rather light sleeper haha. 

So this morning, me and my brother and his wife, who my daughter absolutely adores, all had breakfast together before starting the packing. My brother borrowed a box truck from his work and we managed to get most of the big stuff like beds and couches all in in one trip thanks to the help of some other friends of his from work. Took us most of the day but we got everything settled and hooked up for the most part. 

But the last things we needed were the makeup table  and jewelery box, which were both at MIL's, her grandma. We said our hellos and my daughter gave her the biggest hug I'd ever seen from a kid her size, she's so full of love. Her eyes lit up seeing them in person, even though they were obviously in need of a good painting. I put some batteries in the jewelry box and let her play with and stare at it all the way home. It was the happiest I'd genuinely seen her in I don't know how long. 

And the rest of the evening was pretty chill. I asked her again what she thought of the place and she was still kind of adjusting to the whole thing but I could tell she was a little bit happier about it, even saying ""I think I'll like it"". There's still some small stuff to move in which we'll do tomorrow probably and I told her I'd bring her with to see the place one last time before handing over the keys back to the landlord. I'll admit I did get emotional a bit seeing us move all our stuff out, but just had to carry on. 

I also meant what I said about my wife and her living on through us. I'm not religious by any means nor spiritual, I just think she lives on through our memories and our character, who we are. And I know that wherever she is, she'd at least be proud of what our baby girl has become.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mes5wz/we_moved_today_and_im_just_glad_my_daughter_likes/,2021-03-28 02:03:13,1,4,0

Ledifen,Today I recieved a parcel that was in the wild for exactely 1 year,"I live in Belgium. Last year (End of February 2020), I went to the south of France for my internship. There were a few things I forgot from home and I was short on important medecine so I asked my mom if she could send me a package with them. 

She does. With the help of my father and sister, she sends me a lot more than what I had asked (tons of cute stuff because we all missed each other). **She send it on the 17th of March 2020.** 

I never received it. Unfotunately, with Covid19, there was a lot of problems and nop matter how hard I try, no one would tell me where my parcel was. I eventually came back to Belgium thinking *we'll never see the package again*. The people working for the post basically told us that. That meant a lot of trinket with tons of emotional value were lost forever.

**BUT NO! Today, on the 17th of March 2021, guess what came in with the mailman? You guessed it : My parcel.** I was excited like a kid in front of Christmass presents. I opened it and **pretty much everything is in good shape**. A frame got a little roughed up, but nothing a little glue couldn't solve. A few items of clothing need a wash (smelly \^\^) but that about it.

huntsman_459,I did what my wife always wanted to and am in the final steps of getting our first house,"A two story single-family home in the suburbs that will still allow our daughter to go to the same school she does now and is honestly just perfect in every way. My wife passed away a year ago and we always dreamt of owning a house, even if it was just the three of us. I honestly can't even express how happy this whole situation makes me.

I took a tour of it a few months ago with my daughter and I myself fell in love with it immediately. It has just about everything we could ever need from a space perspective and also has spare bedrooms that I especially want to have a home office in one. It's nothing too big, but I know my wife would be more than satisfied if she could see it.

Though, obviously, my girl was a little less than thrilled about the prospect of moving at first for one obvious reason: she's never moved before. The apartment we're at now is all she's ever known. Though I got some advice from both my family and others on this site about how to possibly get her more on board with wanting to move, since her mom's passing was still on her mind. So I had an idea and am going to not only let her paint and decorate her room however she wants, I'm also going to give her some things that belonged to her mom. One is an old fashioned makeup mirror (or whatever it's technically called) that she had when she was growing up, and the other is a jewelry box with a ballerina in it that was actually my wife's grandmother's. I showed both of them to her and immediately I saw a change in her. I also told her I'd let her paint both of them on her own if she wants.

Home inspection has already been done and nothing noteworthy to affect the sale was found since the owners had been taking exceptional care of it since they moved in, even adding on to it in a few places. My landlord also knows about the move and the timing was extremely important since my lease ends this month, and he's basically gonna give me a month or so to move everything out once it's up.

But honestly, the thing that made this all easier is my girl. Ever since I told her about her getting my wife's mirror and jewelry box, she's been significantly more into the prospective move. She's been a little forlorn though, just knowing how many memories she's had here. And it's shaken me up a bit too. This is the same place we brought her home from the hospital to when she was born, where almost all of her birthdays have been and so much more.

TheGothamEmpire,Finding My Passion through unexpected means.,"It always makes me wonder why the YouTube Algorithm decided to recommend me a movie clip from Son of Batman almost three years ago now. I have never watched a single comic-related video up until that point. 

Though, looking back at my past, there’s always been a pull towards it. Whenever someone would ask, “Batman or Superman?” I would automatically pick Batman without knowing a single thing about him. And whenever we would go to Party City, I would always put on a Batman mask.

Could it have been destiny? Fate? Whatever it was, I’m sure glad I decided to give in and watch it. It introduced me to a whole new world of art and entertainment. I feel that it changed my life for the better. It got me out of the habit of drawing only cats, I started improving faster, I became more confident, and I even started working on my own Batman comic. 

Three years later... I have a Batman tattoo, a bunch of merchandise, art, and I feel like I finally figured out what I was meant to do in life. My dream. My passion.

Thank you to whatever happened that fateful day. August 4th, 2018. The day I started discovering myself.

AnchoredEnclosure,"My daughter said ""I love you too"" to me for the first time since me and my wife divorced","We love our daughter (she's 13 btw), we just don't love each other. That's honestly the best way to describe the relationship at this point. We look at each other and we know there's just nothing there anymore, no deep, yearning love like when we first met. But no hostility either. We see each other as good friends who genuinely care about each other, but leave it at that. Needless to say the divorce was amicable. We each had our own attorneys for representation's sake, but the filing was fairly straightforward and our visitation agreements between our daughter was agreed upon.

I have to thank my (now ex) wife for making it significantly easier for our daughter to comprehend and make peace with. She really was able to get through to her much easier than I was. She made it clear that none of it was her fault, not in the slightest, and that we both loved her equally. The hardest thing was just us not being together. She couldn't quite wrap her head around that, even though her ears had to listen to some of the more intense arguments we had between me and my wife.

Anyway, getting back on track, we had just finished dinner together and my daughter was still on that tipping point: being a little withdrawn since the separation, but not fully shutting me out either. She went to her room and I was doing dishes and I hear her screaming over the phone at someone, the angriest I've ever seen her. I go to her door but then stop myself and just think ""Let her get it out"", and so I just stand there listening to her call someone a ""fu--ing cu-t"", ""bi-ch"", you name it, and I'm just like ""Woo man, hate to be on the other end of that call"". Eventually things go quiet and I slowly open the door. She immediately tells me to fuck off but I can tell she doesn't mean it, she's just angry at the world.

So I sit down next to her and just very calmly ask her what happened. Here's the jist: Some girl from school that she was in a group chat with said that her mom must be happy to be out of the house and is probably already with another guy because I supposedly wasn't keeping her (my wife) ""satisfied"" enough, and also that they'd probably still be together if it wasn't for her (my daughter). Yes, another 13 year old kid said that, hand to God. And then my daughter basically gave the ""You have no idea what you're talking about"" rebuttal and layed into her, defending me in some way. There's more to it but that's essentially what went down, some girl tried being a troll for shits and giggles.

As she's going into more detail, she's on the verge of tears and I just hold her hand and scoot closer to her, telling her that none of it is true and that she shouldn't listen to her. Even though she's nodding her head in agreement, she kicks her nightstand out of anger and knocks a glass over and it shatters and she screams ""Fuck"" at the top of her lungs. This sends her over and I take the opportunity and just hold her tight against my chest as she bawls her eyes out, screaming and crying at the same time. After she wraps her arms around me, all I can think to do is let her carry on, just softly repeating ""It's okay baby, I'm here"" and ""It's gonna be okay baby. It's gonna be okay"" and I nearly start crying just seeing her like this.

She starts coughing from crying and yelling so much and I just rub her back and kiss the top of her head over and over to help her calm down. She eventually gets to a point where she isn't crying anymore and is just staring out into the hallway. I let the silence just sit there for a few moments before I get her to look at me and stare directly into her eyes and say ""I love you sweetie. You're gonna be okay"" and kiss her forehead before she says ""I love you too"" and I smile warmly but she doesn't smile back, yet I still just hold her close and we sit in silence.

I know this was probably a build-up from all her anger and rage she was holding in since the separation, and I don't blame her for being that way at all. After she finally was really calm, I asked her if there was anything she wanted to talk about but she said no. I reminded her that she can talk to me about anything and we just kind of left it at that.

I know we have a lot to work through, but I'm confident she'll come to terms with the whole thing one day. And if she wants to do something like therapy to help her, I'll be there for her 100%.

aquarianalien,Today something really good happened at my usual Starbucks location :) Pass on the good things!,"So everyday, my housemate and I go to Starbucks without fail. Today we went during the lunch break rush and whoever was in front of us payed for us. In a world that’s as crazy as ours, it was a good reminder of all the good things that still happen. I struggle a lot with my mental health and it made me so inexplicably happy. So we passed it on to the person behind us. We were stuck at the stop sign after the drive thru so I turned around to see the guy stop mid handing the barista his card and then to look at me in surprise. He pulled down his mask to smile and wave and I waved back. (My housemate jokes that I should’ve gotten his number). And then I watched him pull his mask back up and give her his card anyways. I’m not sure how many people it passed through, but thank you to whoever started it and to all of those who passed it on. Remember to be kind, it really can make someone smile on a bad day.

honest_scenario,My niece that I helped raise visited me for the first time since starting college!,"So long story short I helped raise my niece after her dad (my older brother) walked out on her and her mom when she was 12. I originally was hesitant about doing it because I was still grieving the loss of my wife years earlier, something I still haven't fully moved on from of course. Me helping raise her were honestly the happiest years of my life. I'm confident in saying she's the daughter I never had and I'm the dad she deserved and needed. I was there for her at her lowest and highest. And letting her go to start college was one of the hardest days in a long time, but I knew she'd be okay. 

We'd been keeping in contact as regularly as possible, texting a couple times a week. And in her absence, I got myself a dog to help with I guess my loneliness, as sad as that sounds (his name's Bullet, btw). He's a Labrador Retriever mix and one of his favorite things is hide and seek. He's as trained as can be and rarely barks at other dogs or people when he's home alone. And obviously coming home to him running up to me never fails to put a smile on my face. 

Anyway, my niece messaged me saying she had a long weekend due to having just finished midterm exams and was going to come over to my place to visit after she saw her mom first (who also was equally there for her, btw). So I'm waiting and waiting and then I hear a car door close in my driveway. I go out and, no surprise, it's her. And the biggest smile imaginable comes across both of our faces as I walk over and we hug each other. And it wasn't one of those hugs you give casually to your parents when you're going somewhere or when you see a good close friend. This was one where we held each other tight, long and didn't say anything. And after I kissed the top of her head hard, the first words I said were ""How's school been, baby?"". 

And she laughs and we head inside. The even bigger surprise was that she hadn't even gone to her mom's yet, she came to see me first. This just melted me. I also brought my dog in from the backyard to see her and she immediately fell in love with him. I remember he kept looking at me like ""Who is this?"" and the more I stood next to her petting him the more comfortable he got. 

We then just sat and talked about school and how everything was going (she's going for Education and wants to teach K-8). Basically, she's made some new friends, is in a club for her major and loves most of her classes. 

My life was obviously less exciting haha, only really telling her I'd been seeing other family members, working from home more, started doing some home renovations, all that. And I actually did manage to reconnect with someone I went to high school with and we met up for the first time a couple weeks ago. 

I also showed her something I never had before. It was a photo of me and my wife at the hospital on the day of my niece's birth, and I let her keep it. Rest of the day we spent with her mom and other family and went out to eat together, watched a movie and other cool and exciting stuff. I'm planning on taking her shooting tomorrow, one of her favorite pastimes. Just her being in my presence makes everything better. I know that sounds vague, but there aren't enough words for how much joy she brings me.

White_Notepad,"As of today, I'm officially one year sober. And I'll never forget what inspired me to quit in the first place","I was basically a steady drinker in my late 20's, usually getting drunk at least a few times a week and starting off my morning with a beer or mimosa even if I was feeling fancy. And the kicker? I had a kid. My six year old daughter. And my wife who suffered through all of my bullshit. I was a monster with a bottle in his hand, never abusive or mean to them, but quickly going down a health path I was sure I couldn't recover from. 

And one Saturday morning, I woke up with a hangover like nothing I had ever felt. It was like someone had a sledgehammer and was beating me senseless over the head. Blurry vision, hardly able to stand, and I legitimately, truly thought that the solution was to drink more. So I poured myself a whiskey and threw it back. And I remember feeling this very brief sense of ""Huh, I guess it passed"" before something from my stomach shot up to the top like a volcano and I was basically projectile vomiting all over the kitchen walls, on the counter and in the sink. 

I remember that while my face was buried in the sink now, I found the strength to stand up and collect myself a bit, feeling a bit better and just looking around and seeing the volume of my destruction. ""Wait, *I* did that?"" was immediately what went through my head. But that vomiting wasn't what really made me want to change. It was my daughter having to come out and see it. Yep, she came out of her room and just stood there looking at me and all that vomit. 

And I remember the first thing she said was ""Are you sick, dad?"". And I reassured her that I was okay and that I just had an accident and politely told her to go back to her room for a little while while I cleaned up, and she just nodded and walked away. As soon as she closed her door I immediately burst into tears crying my eyes out on the floor, the stink of my puke really starting to become more apparent. 

I eventually collected myself and scrubbed the whole area down like it was a crime scene. That was the moment I decided to stop. Not my vomiting or me crying, but seeing her standing there just staring in complete confusion and worry. So I also threw out all the bottles and cans that day as well. Anything that wasn't hand sanitizer that contained alcohol was going in the bin. And it stayed there. 

Now it's a year later and, if I'm being honest, I don't feel that different. I mean I'm glad I stopped drinking and that I have my family still with me, but I don't feel any different from a personality perspective. I'm still the same sarcastic and upstanding guy I was before who also loves deadpan humor and can name you 10 of my favorite bands of all time. Nothing's changed, yet everything has at the same time also.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/m485n5/as_of_today_im_officially_one_year_sober_and_ill/,2021-03-13 15:12:51,1,5,0
little_mealmaid,I found out my dissertation/thesis grade yesterday,"I was walking down the corridor at work with a colleague and we got to talking about our degrees (we both study psychology) and I mentioned that it could be any day now that my bachelor’s dissertation/thesis grade would show up. 

And I said that I check daily and I hadn‘t today, so I whipped out my phone to take a look, not really expecting it to be there but as I was talking to her and scrolling down the page there it was!

I literally stopped mid sentence and I almost started crying. I got a 1,3 (that‘s a first class in the UK and a 3.7 GPA in the US)!

After a failed degree a couple years ago it was such a weight lifted off of my shoulders to have handed the dissertation/thesis in, but to receive this grade was so much more than I have hoped for.

FocusedMaintenance,My adopted daughter called for me for the first time ever a today and also clung on to me when she got scared after being shy around me since she moved in with us,"So quick summary: Me and my wife of four years wanted to start a family but my she cannot have kids of her own. So after getting in touch with our local adoption agency, and with them living with us for a few months with us as the foster parents, we officially became the parents of two beautiful girls named Amelia (7) and Judy (11). They had been under the care of an actually very sweet and loving older couple who were their foster parents. But obviously with them getting up there in age, it was getting harder for them to take care of the girls. So that's when we stepped in. 

Now when I say she was standoffish, I'm referring to Amelia. She wasn't necessarily scared of me or my wife or anything like that, in fact she was quite comfortable and adjusted very quickly to living with us. She just saw me as a bit intimidating because I'm rather tall (6'5) and have lots of tattoos. I think she thinks I'm like a biker or gangster or something lol. And anytime I'd ask her something like how school was, it was usually just one word answers. But whenever my wife would ask, it'd be hard to get her to stop talking. This happened when we were the foster parents as well. 

So the incident in question happened earlier this afternoon. My wife had taken Judy to the mall to get some more stuff for school since they both may be going back to in-person classroom attendance soon, and I watched Amelia. We had breakfast together and she politely asked if she could go out in the backyard to play. I was doing some work on my laptop in the kitchen and I hear my neighbor's dog (a German Shepherd) barking and don't think much of it. But then a few seconds later I hear her yell Daddy for the first time ever. I jog outside and see her standing there on the verge of tears as my neighbor's dog on the other side of the chain link fence is sitting there looking concerned. 

I go over and kneel down next to her asking ""What's wrong sweetie? Did he scare you?"" and all she does is nod and wrap her arms around me trying not to cry. I smile and tell her ""It's okay sweetie he's not gonna hurt you"" and I pick her up and she's holding on to me with all her strength. I immediately figure out what happened and know the dog isn't a threat because he is the biggest goofball you can imagine: there was a ball next to the fence that Amelia and her sister must have played with and the dog saw her and made the connection in his head that she wanted to play catch and was trying to get her attention to play. I know this because he's done the same thing when I cut the grass or do yardwork and just wants someone to play with. He's honestly the cutest thing

She calms down enough and, while she's still holding on to me, I get the dog to stand up and hold my hand out for him to sniff and lick my hand and say ""See? He's not mean at all"" and I pet him all over his head and he melts in happiness. I then ask her if she wants to try and she doesn't say anything except slowly reaches her hand forward and lets him smell her and she laughs as he licks her hand and she giggles, and I kiss her on the cheek for good cuteness' sake. I even let her throw the ball and he quickly brings it back and dumps it in her hand and she's laughably grossed out and completely forgets why she was scared in the first place. 

Eventually we both head back inside and I make her lunch and it's like an immediate transformation of how she is with me. I just talk about the work I was doing and she's asking me loads of questions like she does my wife and it really just feels awesome. Just wanted to share this story and hope it made some of you smile.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/m3udgp/my_adopted_daughter_called_for_me_for_the_first/,2021-03-12 23:46:14,1,7,0

80sRetro1,I’m really proud of myself for how far I’ve come and I’m looking forward to what I will accomplish.,"I didn’t have a dad growing up, I had a single mother with cerebral palsy who had to raise two boys. I am the oldest. Before my brother and I were born, she was in a horrible car accident where they didn’t think she’d live. Then they didn’t think she’d walk again, but she made it. She lived and eventually married and had us. 

I am forever in her debt for what she did for us. She raised us and never let her central palsy get in the way. You can’t really tell she has it physically, she just had a weak left hand(which is also slightly smaller than a normal had but I never noticed it) and a limp, mentally I think she has most of her brain, but remarkably, what she was missing the rest of the brain made up for. I didn’t find out she had cerebral palsy until I was 27. I thought all of her issues were from her car accident. 
It wasn’t until one day everything kind of fell into place and it made sense. My wife’s sister has cerebral palsy, so I’ve noticed a few things she does that my mom also did. One day I was sitting on the couch with my mom, holding her hand and I suddenly realized my moms hand was significantly smaller than mine.. and it hit me. She had it too. 

She raised two kids, on disability, alone, with cerebral palsy. The world is cruel. Her family helped but they did the bare minimum, we always thought they were doing the most but as we grew we realized we were just a burden. 

Mom never made us feel like that though, she always made us feel loved. She always took care of us. She’s so incredible. I love her so much, I’m going to give her the world. 

My goal is to give people who never had a chance at things they wanted to do, the chance to do just that. Mom and Emma have both had such hard lives. Being neglected by others, being let down, bullied, the feeling of unloved. I’m going to show them that the world isn’t cruel and that they can have whatever they want. 

My accomplishments by age 27:

At 16: won second place at wrestling tournament 

18: graduated hs, accepted into university 
- dropped uni, went to adult Hs to get math credits-

20: graduated adult Hs, accepted into college
22: graduated college

23: started working in govt job with great salary, benefits and pension, started a YouTube channel and getting super fit
24: crushed every PR I have set, YouTube channel starts doing really well
25: hit 200k on YouTube, considering doing it full time along with govt job 
26: bought a condo with fiancée, started cool series with YouTube channel that is doing well. Considering writing a book out of it? 
27: got married, bought house, won youtuber of the year award, 100k on IG, 40k on Twitter, thousands of loyal fans, videos consistently hitting 20,000 views, made this job a great side job
Expanding YouTube channel with merch and products

My primary goal is to take care of my mom, secondary is to build some sort of animal sanctuary if possible, third is def something for orphans or the homeless. 

Idk where I’m going with all this. I’m just really happy and proud of myself.

shy_arcaneguy74,Found my online friend after half a year of no communication with one another!!,"I don't know if this belongs here, but I but I'm so happy to find my friend I lost a couple months back in late August/Early September. 

So today I was scrolling through the friendship subreddit on u/NeedaFriend when I came along a post of a teenager wanting to befriend others. I was hooked into chatting with this one dude, but as everyone does before sending a message to the person they're willing to talk to, I first had to check the person's post history and the comment history to get a little more info on who this person is, so as I was scrolling through his comment history, I found this one post that sounded so familiar. It said ""[Name of friend] 17M"" and it was months back. So I checked this one person's post history and they had a ton of posts about one specific topic they always talked about with me, which was football and video games. 

After looking endlessly for this one friend through reddit by his username I somewhat remembered, and trying every discord name related to his old tag, I finally thought I found hope when coming across this profile. It was new too. I quickly messaged this person and asked him if his name was what he was called, and he said yes. I continued to tell him that I thought I knew him, questioning him until I told him about who I was and if he remembered and he did, telling me it was actually him. This made me super happy after losing contact with him, I knew him since June of last year, and he was a great friend, and now we're talking with one another on discord again, and I'm just so happy to finally hear from him again! Especially having the weights on my shoulders to finally be settled, where I could explain to him why I disappeared out of the the blue and that he shouldn't worry about anything. 

The most unexpected things comes when you least know it, so if there is something that you don't believe is going to work, or you finally lost all hope, it's all going to be alright in the end. Don't give up! Thanks fo reading, I also wish you a great day or evening!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/m39i56/found_my_online_friend_after_half_a_year_of_no/,2021-03-12 04:18:50,1,2,0
Dragonair_fruit1371,"I came up with a way to be happy, made an app from my experience!","So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

I have been depressed for years, with it getting to the point that I was sent to an in-patient. I've been doing better. Still struggling a lot, but better.

Today after I woke up, I took a shower. A couple hours later, I lied down on the couch. I was propped up with my favorite pillow, the room was cold, and I had a thin blanket. Those conditions made me so comfortable, so cozy, so happy, it was almost euphoric. I felt so safe, not a care in the world.

I cannot express just how relaxed and safe and happy I felt.

sociopathicjiggly,"Best Day Ever At Work, Biggest Pay it Forward Chain, along with an offer of a free meal for staying later.","So I work at a very famous Burger Joint (won't say where,) and I was dreading getting off of work because I had wanted to just cuddle with my cat after being with my boyfriend for a few days. I had already spent a tad bit more at Starbucks then I had anticipated, so I was a little down since the rest of my money went straight into savings. 

So my favorite manager Nicki comes over and asks if I wouldn't mind staying a tad later, I asked 8:30 or 9? 8:30 was fine. I say ok no probs, because she's my favorite. So I'm cashing this old man out, and he tells me to give his change to the next persons order.

I was super happy, and said alright, no problem. Next thing you know, that guy appreciated $3.86 of his order out of 5.40 being paid that he paid for the next person behind them, and the person behind that person, and so on. The biggest amount someone paid? $35 on someone else meal, he didn't even hesitate. My heart was so full I damn near turned into SpongeBob from crying from happiness.

I’m in a real bad place and a friend told me yesterday that I need to find my own happiness. I remember feeling happy with a person or two. But I don’t remember feeling genuine joy apart from that. There’s always been stress, or I have been playing the part. There isn’t a guaranteed happy ending in life, and I’ve always thought there would be. I don’t want to get to the end and realize it isn’t happy. I’m not happy now. It doesn’t seem worth it to me to play and lose.

brokenandtired1,"After 8 years of depression and self doubt, I finally got to achieve a dream I had for a long time!!!!!","Hey guys, I've been a long time lurker and I've finally built the courage to get on here and post. For eight years, like many others I suffered from severe depression, self hatred, self inflicted wounds. The list goes on, recently like last year I got tired of hating myself, walking in darkness, crying myself to sleep every night. So I decided to go on a self love journey, just to see if I could do it. this would be my last result before I took drastic matters.... but it worked. After five long months of digging through my past traumas and laying the skeletons to rest. I found true happiness, now I still have bad days but there nothing like the past eight years of depression and with this newfound happiness, self love, peace. I decided to make my podcast ""One time for a good time"" to talk to the people that are still in a rut, struggling, finding their way in life. I want this podcast to be a place where people can come to be uplifted and find peace. I see a lot of people on here have their ongoing internal battles, and I thought it would be nice if I shared a little piece of my happiness with you guys. So please if you want to check it out that would be great, but if you don't maybe share it with someone you think it could potentially help. Love you guys, stay blessed.

UrbulGroOrkulg,I'm proud of myself for spotting a red flag,"I'm 25, single and I was talking to a girl from Bumble. She has unmatched me in the past but somehow we matched again. I asked her why and she said it was because I didn't message her. I said, 'But I didn't message you for a few hours?'

She said, 'It was a day.'

I didn't think much of it. Bit weird, but whatever. We moved to Whatsapp and we were chatting constantly for a day or two. Bear in mind I have known this girl for literally two days. Today, I've been watching videos from Buddhist monks, painting, went for a walk and helped my dad fix the oven.

She asked me what I've been up to. I said, 'Not much to be honest!' Because, I haven't done many interesting things today. Interesting to me, but not to other people.

She said, 'What are you up to right now?'

I said I was watching Football with my family. She said, 'Ok enjoy your night.' In an obviously upset way.

I asked why and she said it was because I hadn't spoken much today. I explained that I had been keeping busy, as I always do because I like having a full schedule, and I don't go on my phone much. She said, 'Well if you were interested you would make time.'

I took a mindful breath and told her that I was no longer interested in her and I don't think we would get along in the future. I am the sort of person who does not like constant texts. I find them kind of empty. Keeping small talk going throughout the day just because you can is a bad way of living, in my opinion. So I stood my ground. She blocked me.

I just wanted to say, I'm proud of myself for doing this. I am proud of myself for taking a stand before things got further. I'm confused that she blocked me, I find it quite childish. She also went and unmatched me on Bumble. Again, I find this childish.

Her blocking me on Whatsapp and Bumble makes me realise that I have definitely made the right choice. Here's to bettering myself for the future when it comes to self-love! I don't need to constantly message people to be happy. I am happy in my own company!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/m0okme/im_proud_of_myself_for_spotting_a_red_flag/,2021-03-08 20:01:49,1,8,0

Hello guys,

Whenever  I go through harder times I always find it helpful to have a chat with  someone sharing my mindset. So I decided to create an app where you can  match with people that are having same disorders, starting from  depression up to eating disorders/sexual frustration/loneliness etc.

The  app is still in development but  I decided it is ready  enough to share it. If you decide to try it out please leave some  feedback so that i know what can be improved.

Tacocat231,I found a counselor that actually helps.,"Not sure if this fits here: 
Yesterday I (F21) had 4th counseling session with my new counselor. I have been through 5 different counselors in the past and never clicked with any of them. This one however is so similar to me (both female seniors in college) that she can actually understand and give me the proper tools and assessments I need to guide me in the right direction! 

In the past counseling for me has always just been, ""well how does that make you feel,"" or, ""what do you want me to do about it,"" or, down playing my traumatic experiences because they dont believe me. One actually accused me of ""being too hormonal."" 

If you are in a place where you feel as though you need counseling, but feel as though it is not working or being useful, continue to have patience and search for someone that fits you best. Its also important to realize, that everyone is different and that therapeutic approaches may differ. 

I just want to express how happy I am that I found someone that can actually help me! I am so excited that I am now getting the proper help that I have been looking for.

kejennaan,I got a job after so many months of being jobless!!!,"After months of hearing my parents drilling, ""When are you gonna get a job?"" into my ears, I finally get a job with a higher than the average salary and it's related to my Master's Degree!

In 2020, I was in my last semester of Master's. The semester focuses on doing my thesis only and even during then, my parents expect me to have a job WHILE doing my thesis. Not only that, jobs were scarce during the pandemic, even the part time ones. I've applied ALL KINDS of jobs, and they all ignored me. Some even say that I'm too old for a clerical job? (I'm only 28 for goodness sake)

It was a pretty devastating few months, had so many breakdowns and general anxiety attacks that I lost count, thinking that I'm not good enough for anything. When I finished my studies, I went back to my hometown. Even at home, some days, I just lock myself in the room because I can't stand another, ""get a job"" lecture. But I understood why they feel that way; they just want me to be secure and safe financially.

(Just to be clear, I came from an Asian household in an Asian country. So staying with my parents is not only a norm, but expected of Asian children who finished their studies)

I'm just happy that I found a job that I can actually apply my skills and knowledge on. I can finally relax and not feel restless all the time. Moreover, I don't have to make my parents worry anymore.

My advice for job seekers: Don't lose hope, please! I know how empty and unfulfilling it is to look forward to NOTHING during the present time, but keep applying hundreds of jobs. The one that's meant for you will come to you eventually.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lwo7cf/i_got_a_job_after_so_many_months_of_being_jobless/,2021-03-03 07:36:39,60,20,0

surelyshirls,I absolutely love my boyfriend and am so grateful to have him!,"Little fun background story...we matched on Bumble in 2019. We went on one date and it was amazing. However, at the time he was really busy with college and so was I and we simply never ended up arranging a second date. Sometime last year in 2020, he followed me on Instagram. I was super excited...we hadn’t talked in a year and it was so random. 

He mentioned he had been browsing Instagram casually and saw me in suggestions and remembered me. We set a date and quickly went on more. Two weeks later we began officially dating and now we’ve been together for 5 months! It’s been a blast and we’ve done so much. We’ve gone to San Francisco, Big Bear, Yosemite...we’ve celebrated our birthdays, and spent Christmas with my mom, I’ve shown him how to cook, etc. 

My mom loves him. She rarely likes anyone but with him she’s attentive and likes him for me. He’s everything I ever wished for. He takes me out on dates, listens, comforts me, supports me, gets me gifts that I love, etc. Recently I was in the hospital and he spent the whole night in the car outside waiting for me to be released. He helped me shower, get to the bathroom, do physical therapy and more while I recovered. 

When I want to feed the local cats, he goes with me and feeds them. In general he loves me for who I am and as I am, with all the baggage I come with. Which is a lot. I’ve told him about my abortion, my depression, my BDD, and sexual abuse and he accepts me with all of it.

SirHammyTheGreat,I'm crying tears of joy over the two acceptance letters my brother received.,"When I originally got mine, 5 years ago, I didn't know how to feel or respond.

I transferred, graduated, and now I'm feeling a bit better about myself.

My brother on the other hand, suffers from many of the same insecurities and shortcomings in motivation that I did.  He was just offered two scholarships (each about 50% larger than mine) to two colleges he was genuinely interested in.

He's currently in a different state, so I opened his letters for him while on the phone, and I was so happy to give him the news.  After hanging up and sending him the photos, I burst out crying.  He struggles a lot, and I've feared for him.

YaBoySamy,I found the Girl I’m going to one day marry!,"TLDR: Never had a serious relationship until I found the girl I’m one day going to marry. 

This will probably get buried, but at least It’s here. After years of never having a relationship that lasted longer then like a week I’ve found the one, I’m going to marry. 6 months ago I re-met a girl from my past. I remember really liking her whenever we hung out, but I never really got to know her that well and it had been years since we had seen or talked to each other.  (Because she lives 6 hours away) When we re-met we instantly hit it off and within a few days of catching up we decided we wanted to date. We took it slow for the first 5 months and stayed in the unofficial staged, until last month we officially started dating. I love her so much, I honestly don’t deserve her and I thank God for her. It feels so surreal knowing that I finally found the “One”.

What was supposed to be a 6-month job to help me afford my dream camera, turned into 5 years of stress, anxiety, long days, early mornings, late nights, and irregular schedules. I’ve worked about 50 hours a week for almost two years now- only getting two days off in a row if I specifically requested it. I didn’t get medical, PTO, or any other benefits besides 30% off meals.

Starting tomorrow, I get 3 weeks PTO, Sat/Sun off, I start at 9am and I’m off at 5pm, I get medical, and the best part, my pay has increased. By a lot.

It appeared to me that the little fella was just starting to learn how to ride his bike without training wheels.    
I can still remember, 20-odd years later, how elated I felt when finally achieving such a feat myself. So I called out to the boy as I passed by him and his dad, “Who needs training wheels when you’ve got superpowers? You can do it! Go for it!”    
Next thing Dad and I know, that little guy has the biggest smile on his face and he’s zooming off down the path like he’s known how all his life. His dad trotted off after him, throwing a thumbs-up back at me and my dad in thanks.

Dragonair_fruit1371,I was not happy but then I worked to improve my mental health and ended up making an app for everyone!,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called **Happyer** which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

Today I was enjoying my tunes on my new earbuds. My first new thing I have bought myself in years (mom). I love them.

Well on this wall a man with a larger bulldog tries to approach me. I have a pug and a puggle. 2 small dogs. He was using his size and the size of his dog to cross my 6 foot boundary. He then starts to talk to me without a mask on. I am obviously uncomfortable so I back up and dial my SO. (A trick I learned to politely end a conversation with someone being overly aggressive). The minute the guy heard his voice he backed off and left. But not before I knocked out my earbud.  This made me break down in tears. I just wanted to walk my dog.  

I was frantic looking for it as my SO pulled up to pick me up. It was white though and everything was white. After an hour, even when he soon joined me, I could not find my precious gift to myself, that silly wireless earbud. 

I was inconsolable. So he has driven me down to the store and is getting me a replacement. He doesn’t make much so this is a huge gift. My Prince Charming.

last_goodbye1,My uncle turns 55 today. He's told me before that I was the reason he kept living,"So, let me start from the beginning. My dad walked out on me and my mom when I was four, my sister was two. My mom just couldn't balance work and having to take care of us, so we all lived with my grandparents (her parents) until I was six. It was a pretty normal and fun time, though I don't remember much about it. Eventually, my mom got her life together more and had a high enough paying job to get us a townhouse, and that's where I grew up all the way until college. 

But now my aunt and uncle (mom's brother) come into the picture. When I was 10, my cousin that I was excited to meet was unfortunately stillborn. It...it shattered our family. Though it seemed to shatter my aunt the most because she repeatedly tried to take her own life and had to be institutionalized and receive psychiatric care. During that time, my uncle also slowly deteriorated mentally and rarely talked to us anymore. 

But one weekend, about a year later, I took it upon myself to visit him. He was basically half drunk and depressed but was nonetheless surprised to see me, in a good way. I just kind of talked to him about my life and what sports I was doing at the time and boys and all that boring stuff. But it wasn't boring to him. I eventually brought up Sarah (their daughter that was stillborn) and he immediately was getting ready to shut down, but I reassured him that he and my aunt would have been great parents, and he broke started crying a bit. 

But then I started breaking down and crying my eyes out because I didn't want to lose him. He hugged me tight and, apologizing for being the way he was, called me ""baby girl"". I don't know why, but being called that with such genuine love and affection made me cry happy tears. 

Things got better between us after that and he started showing up for more of my games, drove me to school in the winter instead of having to wait for the bus, and we visited my aunt more often (and my mom and sister came too) and she was slowly getting better also, finally leaving at the end of that year and she hasn't attempted to harm herself again. 

My uncle was like the dad I never had in a lot of ways. And me being around made him feel like a proper father but also gave him purpose in life again. He's told me before he was extremely close to ending it because he just didn't know what to do with himself anymore.

LegoPoppin,I found the person I want to spend the rest of my life with,"I haven't had the best luck when it comes to relationships but I think I finally found the one who I actually love with all my heart.

I (23f) have been dating my SO (23m) for over a year now and it's been the best year of my life. I've never felt this happy or this comfortable or felt like I actually mattered in a relationship before and I'm still not used to it. Even though I'm not used to it I love the feeling of being on cloud nine and having my heart flutter everytime he message me or compliments or tells me how lucky he is to have someone who cares about him as much as he cares for me. I'm unconditionally in love with him and I want to show him how much he means to me every day and spend the rest of my life with him. 

I've never felt this appreciate it that I actually matter to someone before and it feels good he is the one person I want to tell everything to and is honestly my best friend! I can be my weird dorky self around him and he finds it cute, he makes me laugh and smile until it hurts (in a good way) I constantly think of him and have dreams of him when I fall asleep each night! I imagine what it would be like to move in with him and to get married to him and what our kids would look like, which is totally out of character for me because before I met him I never wanted to get married or have kids of my own! 

I definitely feel like it was destiny that we met as cliche as that sounds but honestly at this point I dont mind he is my soulmate and I believe we were ment to find eachother and spend an eternity with eachother.

I'm just so in love that I ache to be with him and I miss him every second of every day that we can't see eachother in person due to what's going on in the world at this moment. 

I don't know how to handle feeling like this!  Any advice?

It's pretty touching and pretty selfless of all those people to let a kid name their creation that they spent years building up and supporting and worked on.

WHAXMusic,Finding Denver's Happiest Walkers Through Music,"Hi!

I'm an indie musician in Denver who makes music in my garage. 

I wrote a new song about the mood-lifting power of a good walk (this year has given good reason for needing this a lot.)

Then I wandered around RINO (neighborhood in Denver) with my videographer brother looking to film ""Denver's Happiest Walker.""

It was good vibes for all and thought it would be a fun video for the community to be happy and walk to!

Here's the video in case you want to check it out!

We used to listen to the music of a very popular artist together and be huge fans. This artists music has made my life much more bearable as their music has helped me not go down a dark abyss, because it's a reminder of my brother --it's a very strong connection. 

A friend of mine has the capability of making it so I can meet this artist and have a conversation with them, to be able to thank them for making life happier and easier for me. The fact that I am going to be meeting this person once covid is over, cures years worth of pain, even when I haven't even met them yet.

I've always thought of myself as a happy guy (15) but recently I've been getting mood shifts in being happy with friends to the point of screaming with them in discord to just straight up tearing up for no reason. Doesn't help at all that i also got to lose my left nut from torsion so that kinda sucked but i wasn't as devastated as my parents when this happened. Im kinda confused with myself as i get sad and happy about the little things but the bigger things i seem to ignore or just not affect me as much. Is there like a way or tips on how to just control emotions way easier or something? Friends have just said the usual things like do different hobbies and hang out more but in the end, my days currently end with me just sobbing up a bit before bed then tomorrow happens to me like nothing happened. Others say im depressed but i don't think i am since im not really too sad or atleast im sure that its worse than what i have. Need thoughts from strangers here to add to what i should think about to improve myself.

My name is Maks and I work a 9-5 job as admin assistant but sometimes edit videos and do artsy stuff. This video is for a song made by my friend and artist Alexandra Sawyer-Hudson aka Mee and The Band.

We are close friends and I worked with and for her a few times before. This is the latest product of our relationship , the music video - edited by me! I received a small payment for this but all views money goes to her and everyone else who looks after her.   


Editing this took me out of a dark place during the lockdown, I must say it was hard, getting up and trying to stay consistent and focus... There was a point where I lost my files, had to redo things and it was all just crumbling down, I felt bad because I got paid half in advance and I am failing to deliver... I somehow managed to find the power within me to finish it, that's why it makes me happy - because I found empowerment in what I can do. Some poeple will like this, some people won't , all I want to share is some love.

Ok-Sentence1255,Today I got my first 8-5 job and I feel the biggest weight lifted off my shoulders. I finally get my life back!,"I know it doesn’t sound like much, but I’ve been working since I was 16. Mostly teenager jobs: hosting at restaurants, serving, and delivering pizza when I turned 18. I got my first “fancy” job working front desk at a hotel when my son was 6 months old. 3 1/2 years later and I’ve been stuck in hotels. I’ve missed birthdays, Christmas, thanksgiving, family outings and everything in between. My relationship with my son is no where near where I want it to be. He goes to daycare from 7:30am-5:30pm and I’ve worked 3pm-11pm for the past year, and have only had 4 weekends off (no holidays) in that time. I had enough and started applying to jobs. I probably applied to over 30 jobs in 2 weeks. I only got 1 request for an interview and I knew this was my only chance. Today, I was offered the job. 8-5, Monday through Friday, medical, dental, vision, pto, no overtime, NO WEEKENDS, NO HOLIDAYS. My mental health has taken the biggest toll over the past year and I feel like such a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. All of my relationships have been put on the back burner, and it seemed like my life just revolved around work and school for the past 2 years.

gr9bambino,I’m not sure what to title this. I’m so happy that I’m skeptical of my happiness,"I have had a crush on the same girl for a year. She was in a relationship while I drooled over her. Of course, her relationship deterred me from ever pursuing a romantic relationship with her, but we remained close friends through all this time. 

As time went on, we got closer, and it became more and more difficult to hold in my feelings for her. I thought her then relationship was unhealthy because I never saw them together, and she often seemed very sad for no reason. I didn’t want to be the person to end a relationship that wasn’t mine, so I waited… and waited.

The feelings I had for her grew exponentially. I turned down every date proposal people offered me (granted, it was only like 3), and couldn’t find interest in anybody else. I know, it was probably unhealthy to have interest in someone you *couldn’t* believe had any interest in you.

I was set on telling her how I felt, not really in the hopes of being in a relationship with her, but more as closure — the kick in the face telling me I need to move on. (I forgot to mention that we’re both leaders for the same student org — a condition that also prevented me from pursuing her to avoid a bad club environment).

Well, the other day she messaged me about wanting to tell me something but didn’t want to “make things weird”. She told me that she’s had a “crush” on me for a while now, she couldn’t keep on with her other relationship knowing this (she apparently broke up with him a few weeks ago), and it’s gotten to the point where she just wanted to put it out there.

I just find this so incredible. It’s like we both had the same timeline of our mutual “crushes”, and the same force was preventing us from ever pursuing each other. It’s absolutely uncanny, and I’ve never been happier. The 1.5 years of a tantalizing relationship are finally coming true, and I couldn’t be happier.

I’m writing this to make sure all of you out there pursuing a hopeless relationship never lose hope. You never know what might happen. You just might get lucky :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lhomcc/im_not_sure_what_to_title_this_im_so_happy_that/,2021-02-11 16:41:03,1,4,0

Flane108,I asked for the money I deserved and stood up for myself,"I'm a freelance music teacher at a primary school and have only been teaching for a year.
During my country's last lockdown I worked extra hours making sure the students at home had some fun online music classes and working at the emergency day care to provide music classes for the students that couldn't stay at home. 

I made some mistakes in communicating to the school and my employment agency that I would be working extra hours and would have to be paid more (making it so they legally weren't obligated to pay the extra hours).

At first the school refused to pay me in full for the extra work and my employment agency couldn't do anything about it. I was pretty sad and frustated, cause I still have bills to pay. But I decided to go to the principal and stand up for myself, telling him why I deserved the pay, regardless of my mistake. 
I walked up to him, told him my side of the story, while keeping it professional.
He just stood there nodding silently and then he said while walking away: ""I guess I'll see the new bill coming then, send it to me and the school will pay it in full.""

I feel so great that I did that eventhough I was scared for his reaction at first. He even told my employment agency that he thinks I'm an amazing teacher.

carpenter__help,Grew up poor but I’ll be the first in my family to graduate college this May!!,"For the past 2-3 years, I have been working full-time and going to college full-time to earn my bachelor’s degree.

But I am really happy and really proud!

If you read this and you are from a poor background, or your family has mental/emotional baggage—please just know that it is possible to create a different future for your own life. It takes a lot of work and commitment, but it is possible. It all starts with a choice, though.

Supashaka1,"I love you guys, thank you for everything. Why do we judge each other? Spread love, pass it on :)","Last year I started working through my early life trauma. It was really tough, but worthwhile. I've been going through a lot of self reflection, introspection and soul searching, trying to  change my self limiting beliefs. But I just wanted to tell you all how much I love you!

Thank you Redditors, for always being there for me to help me through stuff. I like reading random uplifting stuff on here. I feel so filled with love that it almost feels like my heart will burst and let out love to every random person I meet or interact with. I really mean it, I wish I could take away all your individual sorrows and put a smile on each and every one of you here :) Pain and suffering help us to grow and learn, whatever you're going through don't worry, you'll get through it and be even more beautiful, stronger and wiser for it.

One of the most important things I've learnt is being aware of when we judge others. It's quite natural to subconciously make a judgement of people we interact with, and it can be really subtle so we can be  completely unaware. So I try to be compassionate to others and imagine all the different scenarios they could be going to explain their behaviour. We're all on a wonderful journey of learning and we all have days where we could do better. Every time we see something we dislike in others, it's inevitable that we also have that same trait within ourselves too, which is why it bothers us when we see it.

I then make sure to love them, even if they did something to hurt me. People who are unkind only behave that way because they are missing something in life but don't realise it. It's a reflection of how  they treat themselves, so why not break the cycle and show them kindness. Non-judgement is so freeing, it takes back power that we give to others opinions over us. Pain and suffering help us to grow and learn. Every single person who comes into our life is both a student and a teacher, if we only choose to embrace them!

I've also started something called shadow work so I'm more balanced and not in denial about darkness in the world, but I truly believe accepting dark and light leads to more light. If we focus on what we personally could be doing better, it helps to stop us looking at other people's actions critically. Imagine if we all were to become less judgmental and pass this lesson on to each other, the people who matter to us, it could start a chain reaction for collective change.

Tell someone you haven't heard from in a while you miss them and appreciate them, note how such a simple act of kindness can bring such happiness to them and you.  I hope I truly always feel love for all, and that it is passed on to everyone who reads this, I'm honoured to be sharing this journey of life with you and I appreciate you. I want to make my life about love and working on passing it on to others, and hope others will join me in this. Thank you so much for reading!

Fast forward, I tell her that I am happy for them and that she made a real catch. 
A few minutes later my friend texts me and apologizes for not telling me earlier. I told him not to worry, but he told me that he wanted to tell me when we see eachother in real life again and not with other people around on discord, since he doesn’t want the whole world to know about them.

She'd be the official campus ambassador for the International Model United Nations. I literally can't believe it!

Also, I finally landed an Internship on Quantum Computing (Quantum Machine Learning to be specific) at a start-up, after searching for months. I can't wait to learn all the new things during my work here.

Feeling so grateful and happy tonight. The universe has always conspired for this day and looking back, there's no better time I could connect all the dots. All the struggles, all the failures, all the tears and heartbreaks, it finally paid off.

To everyone reading this. Hang in there tight, my friend. It does get better AND BETTER!!!!

TheRealIraetus,Kind stranger helped me recently even when he didn't need to.,"It's kind of a long story.

I was a fresh graduate back in February of 2020, the pandemic wasn't really a thing in my country back then (but it was probably already widespread by then).

I was supposed to have a job interview but unluckily, the lockdown happened on the day of my interview. Ever since, I have had trouble getting an online job (can't really work an on-site job due to being immunocompromised) and I had to help out at home with my mom. I did make digital art for money, mods for games and other things that fit my expertise, but that wasn't really a job, but it's nice that it gave me some money.

I survived 2020, but recently my 13 year old computer finally broke down, and without it I wouldn't actually be able to do anything I mentioned above, although I did save some money to buy some pretty cheap parts in order to replace my old PC. Due to this, I had to indefinitely stop doing art commissions 

A stranger recently hit me up asking if I could do something for him, and I had to tell him that I couldn't do it due to needing to replace my PC, and he suddenly offered to pay for it, I didn't really want to accept because I didn't really want to loan out money or be any more in-debt but he suddenly dropped a lot of money on my donations for me to be able to build a PC! I'm still being smart with it and just salvaging my graphics card from my old PC as it's the only part that's newish from 2019, but it's enough for me to get another PC that could last another decade at least.

I have to wait 21 days before I'm able to claim my money from Paypal but this has given me a solid push and maybe I could try turning my life around soon, but a win is a win for me and I'm more than happy to take this one.

Sahrion_true,"I made my friend laugh, today its been so long!","Obligatory on mobile, please excuse bad formatting. 
I have this friend, we've known each since around 2009/10, for most of that time we were only really acquaintances with a mutual friend until around early 2019. Something happened and we realised that we both have similar senses of humour, enjoyed discussing opinions on things, and just generally got on like a house on fire. Ironically this happened after she moved to another country with an 11 hour time difference.

At the beginning of last year our friendship really flourished because both of our countries were in lockdown so we both were on social media a lot more. We spoke everyday, joked about, it was fantastic. Around the second half of the year though, she started to drift away and we spoke less and less often. 

I've had history of confusing friendship with attraction so I was scared to say anything to her about the drifting because I was worried she'd get the wrong idea.

I've tried messaging her a few times over the past few months, but the conversations all died pretty quickly. Today though, today I made a joke about forgetting her name that made her properly laugh. And even though the conversation wasn't long like it used to be, it felt so good to get that rapport we used to have back again for a little bit. I almost cried I was so happy. It felt really good.

TLDR: Was losing touch with a friend, but today I made her laugh, and it was like it used to he for a little bit. Which felt nice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/l77o69/i_made_my_friend_laugh_today_its_been_so_long/,2021-01-28 20:23:40,1,2,0

yellingsnowloaf,"After years of feeling out of place in jobs and a life that didn't suite me, I finally landed the perfect career for myself. Instead of just trying to get through each day now, I look forward to the challenges of tomorrow because I know they're making me the person I want to be.","Two months ago I was in such a bad place. The suicidal  ideation was slowly morphing into making a plan. I was laid off in March 2020 and struggled to find a job until this month. The bills were piling up and there genuinely seemed like no hope that things would get better. Everyday was telling myself ""just get through this next week."" For months. 

I had to leave a very good job in 2016 for personal reasons and I missed it everyday. After that, I got into aircraft quality control. I excelled at the job and it paid well, but I hated doing it. 

After three years of that I decided to find the most similar career field to my previous job that I enjoyed so much. 

It was a long process to get hired. Two tests and three interviews over a few months time. Because I was in such a bad spot mentally, I thought that there was no way I'd get this job but I kept going through the process. 

The new job started a little over two weeks ago and I love it even more than I thought I would. I'm excited to go back everyday. The excitement will wear off eventually. However, the feeling of ""this is where I belong,"" is so strong and I truly believe it won't go away. 

I feel like me again. I didn't even realize that I didn't feel like myself these last five years while I started to feel like myself again. 

There's a lot more that I need to learn and improve on to be the best version of myself. I'm happy to do the journey. All of the challenges that I'm facing are just the steps between who I am now and who I want to be.

Nickkachu,I found a treatment for depression that is beginning to work,"When I was really depressed I wanted to find stories of people who found a treatment that worked to give me some hope. I’m finally beginning to feel better so here is my story in case someone else is looking for the same thing.

I’m not advocating for any specific treatment, just sharing that something finally worked for me.

On 12 January I tried to OD on some pills but at the last minute I regretted it, and couldn’t throw up, so I called an ambulance. After the emergency room I was transferred to a psychiatric hospital where I’ve been for the last two weeks. I’ll be discharged on Friday. My health insurance is paying for everything because it’s a prescribed minimum benefit in my country.

Every day here I see a psychologist and psychiatrist. I’ve begun to find and challenge the way I think about many things. The psychiatrist put me on 300mg wellbutrin and I can feel my appetite, attention span and short term memory returning. I just finished reading a book for the first time in 2 years. It’s like the cogs in my brain are beginning to turn again.

There are plenty of lectures and group sessions about a wide array of mental health topics, from learning to control emotions and handle conflict, to learning how most medications work and how our thoughts effect the structure of our brains. 

I’m surrounded by people also dealing with depression, and we share a lot during the group sessions. The relationships I’ve developed here also play a big role in helping me feel better.

I’m nervous about leaving here and returning to work, but now I know I can do it. I now feel that I still want to live in the long run, and that makes me incredibly happy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/l3fjsk/i_found_a_treatment_for_depression_that_is/,2021-01-23 16:45:35,1,5,0
skyultima,The ONLY thing that works for my chronic back pain...,"Just wanted to share my experience in managing chronic neck and back pain for close to 20 years now. I've tried almost every solution you can think of -- orthopedics, chiropractic, physiotherapists, massage sessions, yoga etc. but nothing ever seemed to work. I was desperate for a solution when a good friend recommended me these two products (am not affiliated to them in any way, just wanted to put it out there to help a fellow reddit friend) -- The first solution is a massage mat which derives its origins from an ancient Indian healing method which dates back to 5,000 years ago ([https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat](https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat)). Simply by laying on this mat for 20 mins a day, you'll be in a deep state of relaxation, and this really helps to relieve any aches or pain from your neck, shoulder -- all the way to your upper and lower back.

The second item that really helped me with my condition -- in particular my degenerative disks in the cervical region -- is this neck traction device ([https://the-orthorelief.com/](https://the-orthorelief.com/)) which helps to relief pain by gently stretching your neck and spine.

Hopefully this changes someone's life the way it did for mine :') Cheers, and feel free to reach out to me if you need any other tips!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/l3dfdi/the_only_thing_that_works_for_my_chronic_back_pain/,2021-01-23 14:53:59,1,2,0

possiblyourgf,"My boyfriend is seriously the best guy out there (for me, at least)!","Note: I use the word “we” a lot. I don’t mean to speak for him, it was just the most effective way to write this!


   I just really wanted to tell someone. It’s one of those topics that feel a little too “braggy” to go on about to a friend, so I’ll tell whoever is sorting by new right now! 

   This man treats me with so much love and respect. He makes me feel like I’m the best girlfriend in the world, and I absolutely feel like he’s the best boyfriend. 

   It’s been over 2 years now, and every day he’s constantly doing little things that fill my heart with love. 

   We don’t fight. Red flag? Nope. We’ve never had to fight, because any time one of us has something we feel needs to be discussed, we bring it up in a loving, calm, and collected manner. I feel safe discussing anything and everything with him. Every time, we talk until we reach a place where we each feel heard. Neither of us ever just “roll over” on a subject, we reach a genuine compromise that leaves us content. 

   We’re also semi-long distance for the last year or so.  2 hours apart. Enough to make us miss each other, but thankfully close enough to still see each other in person a couple times a month. While of course I’d like to be closer to him, I truly feel like the distance has made us closer. He gives me feelings of trust that I can’t put into words. 

   I texted him a paragraph explaining a concern I had, and told him that it was totally okay if he’d rather talk about it later, since I was feeling a little sensitive and it was the middle of the day while he was getting things done. Instead of texting me back, he called me. To me, that was a huge act of love of compassion. 

   He could have texted me back about it, or tell me that he’d rather speak on it later. Instead, he took the time to go to a private place so he could hear me out and understand better. Which I liked for a lot of reasons, but especially because it allowed me to truly understand his side as well. 

   It’s just like, in every situation he always either does the objectively “right” thing, or he goes above and beyond. 

   That’s it I guess, I could talk so much more but I’ll leave it there! My heart is full, and I’m really r/happy",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/l2ynum/my_boyfriend_is_seriously_the_best_guy_out_there/,2021-01-22 22:24:58,1,6,0

pudgieducky,"I met my OCD match, and have never been happier: a feel good story.","I (23f) met my partner (27m) at the restaurant we both work at. When I met him, I thought he was some random 17 year old kid who was our new dishwasher. Turned out to be a very young looking 28 year old man who would be joining our prep team. I've always had a thing for gingers. We worked together everyday for a full year, and I really liked how he operated. He was so clean, efficient and amazing at multi tasking. This guy could crush a whole prep list in an hour or so, while the kitchen area was spotless, no dishes and a clean apron. 

There was this one time we went off in a rage of passion about how specific ""crunchies"" should he stored alphabetically, use first on top, refills underneath, with all the tape labels facing the exact same way (on messier chef wasn't putting them away properly) And that was the exact moment I knew I had to have him. I caught myself always staring at him as he went back to his station. Over the weeks and months we ended up closing together and we would walk from downtown towards his parents house, and my apartment, taking me to my door everytime. I know he did it just to make sure I got home safe, but I knew he loved it too. 

I started inviting him in to play Mario games on my wicked gaming setup. We spent the whole summer crushing services and playing video games until 3am most days. Everytime he would leave, I would walk him down and he would say ""I can't believe how late we always end up hanging out"" and after a full year of making sure he was what I wanted, I asked him out.

He hadn't been with anyone for 4 years before me, and was very anxious and vanilla, but having to start from scratch didn't bother me. On our first date while playing jenga at a bar, some kids ran into the restaurant and threw lit firecrackers at the tables in the back. We thought it was gunshots and the restaurant cleared out. It was so scary and intense.. long story short we got free takeout and went home to play video games. I just remember feeling okay if that was the end and we were going to die. I finally got to go out with him.

Another thing I really love about him is how passionate his is about proper recycling, composting and purchasing things in bulk with jars. I watched him today in the recycling bin aisle picking new bins. He was in such deep thought about picking the right ones and kept bouncing ideas off me. I just watched him in awe with  big ol silly grin. It made me giggle and feel warm inside.

Almost 2 year later we now live together in our very labeled apartment. Our favourite activities are putting away groceries and cleaning out the fridge together, reorganizing things in our home, and being the ultimate completion-ists with our video games. He finished Mario odessy with 100% and it was super cute how excited he got when he beat the entire game and all it's moons.

He fills my beside water, makes my bed when I forget, wipes down the calendar and starts the next month 10am on the 1st of the month. He fluffs the pillows on the couch, wipes down the electronics, and cares so much about how the bathroom looks and smells. He gives so much of a fuck about himself, manscapes all his areas to be well groomed, gets haircuts on the dot every 6 weeks (prebooks the next one when he's there) and has an amazing bedtime skin routine. 

We never argue, we communicate our wants, desires and thoughts. He problem solves quickly, goes right to Wendy's for exactly what I would order when I'm pissy on my period. And watching him make  to do list and cross the entire thing off in a few days makes me wetter than the ocean. 

I never ask people to do things for me because 1. I want it done a very specific way and 2. I feel like an asshole trying to explain how and why I want it done that way. Which I can never explain because I want in done that way because I view it as the correct way in my mind. And one day I realized, I truthfully and genuinely trust this person. If I give them a task or ask a favour he will 1. Do it my way or 2. When I tell him I need it done  certain way he doesn't argue and goes ""I understand that"" because he thinks the same way, which makes me feel whole inside.

My past relationships made me feel with my obsessive compulsive disorder I was unlovable. That the way I liked things was unachievable and too high of a standard. People would often compare me to Monica from friends. I like labels on the food in the fridge, first in first out, super clean windows, I always cared about my entire house being ""setup as if surprise guests would be coming over."" I felt like an asshole trying to get people to clean up better, and to give more of a fuck. I had come to terms with the fact I could date for fun, but not for a long term serious relationship. I was told no one would clean up at 3am after a board game night because they were too tired to do the dishes, put the pieces in the correct boxes, and reset the living room.

Until I met you.

You made me feel like I wasn't alone.

I love you.

Always yours,

Wilted_Ivy,"I'm anemic, but I've finally gotten my nails to grow a bit!","Usually my nails are really brittle and peely, and they snag and break up to the nail bed constantly. I got tired of it because I love painting my nails, and so I've been taking a slower release iron and some biotin, drinking more water, painting them daily with OPI Nail Envy or Essie Grow Faster, and filing away any trouble spots the second I see them with the most delicate glass file, even on top of the nail. I've also been massaging my cuticles and the nails themselves with oil between painting. (Just an hour or two without paint, more than that = breakage.) 



The result is that my nails, while all are very slightly different lengths, haven't broken yet! I feel so much more feminine. I used to get fake nails occasionally, but the dremel actually hurt on my sad nails, as did the acrylic itself while it was wet; it really burned. Removing them was a nightmare even if they didn't snap part of natural nail off. I usually had to get them done once and then wait until that damage grew completely out to do it again. But no more!

I think about her, and I feel absolutely nothing, I think of her and what she’s doing with her new man, and I feel absolutely nothing.

I was desperate for a solution when a good friend recommended me these two products (am not affiliated to them in any way, just wanted to put it out there to help a fellow reddit friend) -- The first solution is a massage mat which derives its origins from an ancient Indian healing method which dates back to 5,000 years ago ([https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat](https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat)). Simply by laying on this mat for 20 mins a day, you'll be in a deep state of relaxation, and this really helps to relieve any aches or pain from your neck, shoulder -- all the way to your upper and lower back.

The second item that really helped me with my condition -- in particular my degenerative disks in the cervical region -- is this neck traction device ([https://the-orthorelief.com/](https://the-orthorelief.com/)) which helps to relief pain by gently stretching your neck and spine.

Even when the tests I begged for came back abnormal they still told me I was doing it to myself and I was devastated. I spent the last year and a half doing everything and I can and I still haven’t felt better it’s just gotten worse. My psychiatrist, therapist and fiancé told me to give it one more shot so I went back to a new office to try again. This doctor was appalled by my previous care and immediately ordered two pages of blood tests. She also found a heart murmur, irregular heartbeat and tachycardia so I’m getting an echocardiogram, we have a CT and endoscopy for my GI issues and she’s ready to send me to an adult GI who will do invasive tests.

throwaway-gsyvyhth,Escaped friendzone - 6 weeks later and I didn't blow this up,"At the beginning of December 2020 I broke the chain. Thanks to one social accident and few drinks I admitted my feelings to my friend (that I have a massive crush on him). And I was not rejected! It turned out we shared similar feelings. So next was a date. I have never been so stressed and excited at the same time in my life. Thankfully I didn't ruined it, so it went even further and we had sex. I still think that I somewhat ruined it a little - in my defense I never thought that a man could give me such intense orgasm. There was one red flag morning after, when he asked me to not spread the word about us for a few weeks (especially in our work and work-related grup of friends - he is my coworker and supervisor). I agreed, but deep down I was scared that this relationship will quickly end. But it didn't. Week later he told me that he arranged my transfer to different team, so he will no longer be my boss, asked me to spend some holiday's time with his family and to announce our relationship to our friends (if we won't spill that earlier) during New Year's celebration. At the end it went great. First part of Christmas holiday's we spent with my family and everybody loved him. My mother told my in private that she never saw me so happy. Next two days we spent with his family and they all are so caring and loving (with only his sister joking about our age gap). Our announcement during New Year's party ended with few 'finally' from our friends.

Sometimes I could not believe we are actually together. That one day this dream will end and we will be just friends with me stuck in his friendzone. Other than that I am also happy that we are still friends, of course right now we spend more time together, we are doing new things as a couple, sex we have is the best sensation I've had in my whole life (I am a little bit ashamed that if that would be up to me we wouldn't leave 'bed'), but at the same time he is the same person as before.

Throwaway101955,My girlfriend is feeling nervous and texted me in the middle of the night asking for a picture of me to help her feel better,"I've been dating this girl for the past 4 years.... we've been best friends for almost 5 now.  We've had our ups and downs sure, but I couldn't imagine spending my life with anyone else.

She's in the process of moving right now.  She got an amazing new job across the country (US) and so is currently driving there.  I'm a PhD student who does mostly theoretical/computational work, so my advisor has given me his blessing to move with her and work remotely on my research, once I finished up some inperson work here.  (She was also one of his students, so he cares a lot about both of us.  He's a great guy but not super relevant to the story haha).  

I'll be flying out next week.  But she's mid-way through her drive across the country.  She stopped tonight after 13 hours of driving, we talked for a bit then she went to bed to get up early tomorrow for another full day of driving....  but half an hour after she had gone to bed, she turned her phone back on and texted me about how nervous she is about this big move and asked me to take a picture of myself for her.

I of course sent her one immediately and talked to her a bit more to help calm her nerves til she fell asleep.

Now, I love this woman.  And one of the things I love most about her is how independent she is.  She'll be the first one to tell you, she never wants to be dependent on anyone.  She's brilliant and hard working and has succeeded at some really difficult stuff...  I really am so proud of her and so proud to be able to call her my partner.

And yeah... we SAY we love eachother a lot, we SAY we're partners, we SAY we're always there for one another, etc....  but tonight was just a moment where, it wasn't just saying it.  She was nervous, and wanted to see my face so she could rest easy.  I got to be the man who supported her when she needed it.

I dont know.  It wasn't a huge deal.  In context, its just a small moment among the years we've known one another...  She's sound asleep now, and I myself am only half awake haha.  But it just feels nice to know that someone like her could so genuinely want me in her life.  And keep me so close to her heart.

I guess I'm just really happy to be there for her.  I just can't stop smiling about it as im falling asleep right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kydo6e/my_girlfriend_is_feeling_nervous_and_texted_me_in/,2021-01-16 06:25:02,1,5,0

However, with my wife's work making her remote due to COVID (and with no foreseeable plans in the immediate future to change that) and my work already being entirely remote, our options opened up significantly. One thing led to another and long story short we eventually decided to build a home, so we went lot hunting. And two days ago we closed on what we plan to be the place to start and raise a family. 

Five acres of gently sloping land in SE Idaho overlooking the Snake River, with at least high speed cable already stubbed to the lot, and fiberoptic currently being rolled out across the county so we can both still work remotely. Right now we couldn't be happier.

Between X-mas and New Years someone called my work number asking a technical question in an area I know nothing about, but it looks just like something I know about, because naming things in the government is done entirely without imagination or precise distinction. I called them back asking for clarification.

When I was able to identify that I was not the person to contact I could have just sent them into bureaucratic hell, but that would have been another stain on my soul. Instead, I decided to own this problem and be this person's solution finder. It took being redirected twice and another person committing to help find a solution, but we were able to save someone 2% of their hospital bill for more than a month.

happy-bucket-life,"After graduating college, the real world hit me in the face. Prioritizing exercise has made me so much happier :)","The way that I view exercise has changed as I have gotten older. 
I got plenty of physical activity growing up without thinking about it, which turned into easily burning crazy amounts of calories daily in high school sports. I had to be more intentional about working out in college, meaning stopping by the gym in between classes to de-stress from studying, lectures, and tests. Whichever the case was, I have always been passionate about exercise. Post-college life, however, forced me to reframe my exercise mindset.

After graduating college, the real world hit me in the face. 
From morning coffees, to a full workday, to hours of evening commitments (if you know, you know), it was tough to find time to go for a run or hit my apartment workout room. I didn’t have a strong motivator and I didn’t have time for the long workouts that I could fit into the middle of any given weekday in college. One thing I did have was the desire to figure out what would drive me to prioritize exercise on my packed to-do list.

Physical &amp; mental health
Living an active lifestyle has always helped both my physical and mental health. Working out makes me feel stronger and more fit; working out also clears my head, relieves stress, and drastically improves my mood. As adults, we are constantly doing things for others: family, friends, coworkers etc. I truly believe that it is necessary to dedicate time for yourself and the things you enjoy in order to succeed in every other aspect of your life. Prioritizing my physical and mental health became the motivator I needed to delegate the minutes and hours in my day to exercise. 

Finding time
Finding time will always be a struggle. This past year and a half I have had to change the way I approach working out to align with my motivator and circumstances. Being active doesn’t always mean spending 90 minutes in the gym. I have learned to love things like going on a walk in the morning before I start my day, spending a Sunday hiking, or finding a 30 minute HIIT workout to do during my lunch hour. As long as the activity I choose excites and energizes me, it is always worth the extra effort.

My motivators to exercise may continue to change throughout my life. Getting creative and finding the time for physical activity allows me to continue prioritizing something that I enjoy so much. What is one thing that you do to prioritize yourself?

Terrible_Register_86,My 5y.o daughter has made my depression go bye-bye,"My daughter is an absolute angel

The whole COVID-situation has been rough on my mental health for a number of reasons, and despite trying to keep up appearances, my youngest daughter (5y.o) has picked up that I am a lot more silent and less energetic than before. A few minutes after her bedtime tonight, she came up from her room into the living room and walked straight towards me. She wanted to give me another hug. She was hugging me, and I thought it would be the usual quick one, but she gave me a really long hug, like a couple of minutes long, while patting my back. I suddenly realized this tiny little girl was comforting me, a 6 feet 95 kilo bearded man and I found myself having tears running down my face. She smiled and said ""I love you, Dad"" and went back to her room again. I have not felt so unconditionally loved before in my life and it was just what I needed to hear.

At first I would dye it even though it wasn't major and didn't bug me, just because I felt like I was supposed to. My mom did,y grandma did. I have dark hair so you can really see it. 



But really like...I love my greys. I think they look super beautiful in the sunlight especially, and so shiny! I stopped dying it altogether a while ago (on the long side, about a third is shaved, which I dye fun colors,) and I adore them. Like yes. Good job, body. I earned my sparkles fair and square, and I intend to appreciate them! 



My toddler likes to run his fingers through my hair and admire mommy's ""tinsel,"" and ngl I find myself doing the same when I'm doing haircare stuff.

ponysniper2,Had my first zoom date today. And it went amazing!,"To say life has been rough recently is an understatement. This has single handedly been the hardest time period of my life. Every day is an uphill battle fighting my new chronic illness and crushing stress to make sure I keep a roof over my family's head. Tomorrow isnt promised given no one knows wtf I have atm. But even through the immense pressures and feelings of complete loneliness, I push through as much as I can and am trying to remain as optimistic about life and my situation as possible. 

Well tonight I got a little break. I had an awesome zoom date off tinder (Never thought this shitty app worked based off multiple uses with no results). Im not expecting marriage or anything crazy. But im so happy someone looked at me and didnt think I was worthless for being sick. That they liked me for me and were willing to work through my unexpected and uncontrollable problems. That I could still be attractive despite feeling like everything is trying to bring me down atm. Im happy and thankful that someone just cared to be there for me after being through some rough shit. I may not believe i god, but idk. Sometimes i genuinely feel like something watches over me and helps me out when I need it the most.

We talked for way longer than expected and probably could have talked through out the whole night lol. The vibes were just there and it felt amazing. She seems like such a sweet girl and I really love the intellectual vibes she gives off. For so long Ive wanted to talk to a potential partner that I could have deep and meaningful conversations and like they could keep up with me and/or surpass me, and I finally felt that feeling today.

I dont want to get too ahead of myself lol But im optimistic and very excited after having kicked it off so well and I cant wait for our next zoom date and inperson date we scheduled c:

DelusionPhantom,Somebody I didn't know made art of a fan story I've been working on the past 2 years and it made me happy cry :),"The context for this is that I'm a huge Borderlands nerd and I talk a lot about it and a show called H2O: Just Add Water on my Tumblr where I merge them as they're my two childhood joys. It's a really weird/niche combo that I did for myself, not expecting anything to come of it other than it being a hobby to combine my two special interests. Well! Today a friend on the site shared with me a post of someone's drawings of a borderlands character, and in that post was a drawing of him with his design from my au with credit to me. 

I started crying a bit (in front of my parents no less) because it made me so happy to see that someone enjoyed my stuff and thought about it enough to draw and color something!!! I cry at the drop of a hat, so this set me off blubbering incomprehensibly. I shared a link to it on my friend discord server once I was composed enough to type real words and all my friends were really happy for me too, which was incredibly wholesome of them and made me cry even harder lol. I haven't stopped smiling and bouncing around since I saw it and I keep going back to look at it because it's such a good drawing and Oh My God. It's so good I must look like a lovesick idiot whenever it's on my screen because I just gush over it- hand on my face, grinning like a madman, and everything. 

I wanted to share this with everyone because I am ecstatic right now :) it's the first time someone I didn't know drew something based off something I made and it's incredibly sweet, I'm so happy and honored right now, like I don't wanna be weird and just keep saying Thank You, but also ahhh its so cool and they literally just made my entire day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ktfhmp/somebody_i_didnt_know_made_art_of_a_fan_story_ive/,2021-01-09 00:10:57,1,2,0

IronMLady,I'm motivated and excited for my future!,"I've always been very unsure of myself and thought I was inherently dumb and had bad work ethic. A little over a year and a half ago I started to finally learn how to handle my mental health, and started seriously building a skillset in my dream career (animation). Despite 2020 as a whole and a bunch of personal crap, it hit me recently that I'm actually doing really good. I'm almost halfway done with my online animation program, I'm starting a super fancy 3d animation mentorship this week, I'm finally going to take my permit test in March, and my new part-time job is something that I actually enjoy (or in other words don't dread doing, unlike every other job I've had haha). I still have a lot to be stressed about but it just feels really nice to see clear progress on my skills and myself as a person. I'll be super busy, but I've proven to myself that I do have good work ethic after all. It just feels super awesome.

Things aren't perfect of course, and these things have their problems, but I'm realizing that they're pretty good problems to have. On top of that my family is mostly very supportive and loving, and my brother and step-family have saved be from isolating into insanity. I'm super grateful and I know that even if I've just jinxed myself right now and things fall apart, I've gotten to know my mental illnesses well enough to bounce back. I feel good about where I am, stress and all, and I feel even better knowing that I did it all myself and proved to my under-achieving depressed high-school self that I'm capable of... idk, not being a total failure.

Justdan73,I just paid some bills with money I made from my Podcast hobby. I'm estatic ! :),"I just started a podcast this past November. I'm almost 10 episodes in at this point and it's been successful enough that my hobby is becoming a fun little side hustle as well. It's really fun and rewarding as well,  to scratch my creative itch and put something out in to the world that people enjoy and find useful as well. 

I'm not here to promote it, this isn't the place for that. I'm just here to share with and encourage others to just go and try something. Take a chance. What ever it is, do it. Life is too short to wait around, make things happen!

Ask_Trixie,I started 2021 the best way I knew how. I danced.,"2020 was a horrible year for me, as it was for many, many people.  So much tension, so much anxiety, uncertainty I couldn't deal with... being trapped in an apartment all by myself, cut off from my friends for months at a time.  I didn't know if I would make it through the year.  But, here we are.  January 2021.  So, after a break from my YouTube videos, I wanted to film myself doing something that would not only ease the tension of the last year, it might encourage others to do the same.  I just danced!

bomber665_ko,"After months of sad reminiscing and what if’s, I am finally starting to move forward and looking at this story in a different light.","

I had these 2 friends who I did everything with for 2 years. We were inseparable and unstoppable. It didn’t matter what we were doing, as long as we had each other we were happy. We did so many random adventures that I won’t go into here but we always wanted to wake up super early and watch the sunrise and also climb a mountain(unrelated). This past summer was our last together because life was getting in the way and we all knew it but we still hadn’t done the 2 last things we wanted to do. 

So on one of the last days of summer we woke up at 4 in the morning and went to the beach. It was the clearest day you could ever see and it was beautifully warm. After that we went and climbed a mountain and finished by 11, all the while pretending or forgetting everything that would come when we were done. 

I was super sad for a while that it was over but I’m starting to realize now that that was a perfect way to end it. I couldn’t have asked for anything better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kpsdr7/after_months_of_sad_reminiscing_and_what_ifs_i_am/,2021-01-03 20:32:24,1,2,0
msameja1990,This is a story about a special person I met over lockdown,"There I was just looking for a challenging game of Scrabble and unbeknownst to me, I was about to meet one of the most engaging, intelligent and charming people in my life.

The connection was strong, the messages were of quantity and quality and the smile was getting wider and wider the more I got to know her. She said that I was good with words yet somehow, I always managed to run out of ways to explain how she always found a way to make me smile even more and ended up with a rather well used phrase “You’re amazing”.

I think at some point, she wanted more words than just that, so she asked me for the reasons why I said that. I tried my best to explain but it never felt enough to me, though to her, she felt it was more than enough, even bordering on me being insane (or maybe she thought I was definitely insane).

When I tried to explain why she was so amazing and unique and special and tried to let her see how I see her, she didn’t really believe me much and thought I was just saying it or that I was biased and didn’t really see her objectively.

Well as analytical as this might sound, here is a rather objective view of her, and why I think she’s amazing regardless of my perspective. 😊

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Intelligent –** She beat me at Scrabble. That is evidence enough! I kid of course, she is very intelligent. Many evidences such as the work she does, the deals she makes, the information she knows and the way she can bring up previous conversations and tie them in, the way she is able to discuss subjects and show sides that people are not looking at, even if she is just playing devil’s advocate. Her love of books got me reading again and her attraction to intelligence and love of learning inspired and motivated me to complete a qualification. Speaking of qualifications, she was **chosen** to attend INSEAD, the top business school in the world! That is not subjective at all.

**Kindness / Good Hearted / Caring** – How can I give specific examples as evidence of kindness when her entire essence is one of kindness to all? She cares about everyone and always wants to help, even doing more than she has to. She is supportive and listens to any issue and if she can help in any way she will do – even if that means telling someone what they don’t want to hear. She will see someone’s weaknesses and make them forget they exist or even make them feel special for them. She will make them feel confident in themselves and be able to be themselves, their real self without hiding anything. She is complimentary and makes everyone feel better about themselves. I personally went from feeling that people usually talk to me when they need me, to feeling wanted and valued.

**Witty / Funny** – Her humour is absolutely fantastic and even though she might say that people think it is too much after a while, I disagree entirely. She is very funny and not just in a jokey way but in a conversational sense; she can tie in previous stories and jokes. Her humour is intelligent, it is not just a bunch of “knock-knock” jokes, but far more than that. She is very witty and can keep anyone on their toes but in an enjoyable way, talking with her is always engaging and never dull or boring. It could be months or years of talking to her and there is no way the subject matter would ever dry up just because of how she can keep a conversation lively, even if it is a conversation that has been had before. I truly believe that this is one of her most amazing qualities.

**Positive / Strong / Brave** – Personally, she is my role model; she is one of the bravest and strongest people I have ever met. With everything she goes through and all the pain I have seen her deal with, she still gets through the day and is more productive than most people I know. She may have a whine here and there and complain about something, but she is human and that is something everyone should be able to do. She used to ask me why I never get tired of hearing her complain and it is because I see how much she fights to improve and be strong and improve and I will never get tired of hearing about it and trying to help her because I feel inspired to do so from her own actions. There are people who complain and do nothing and define themselves by their issues but she is someone who defines herself as this awesome person. She is an inspiration in how, even with any issue, she still faces everything the day has to bring and actually wins every day. I feel really proud and happy seeing her progress since I have met her.

**Fair / Just / Protective** – She once told me that one thing that always angers her is when people bully others and she always wants to stand up for them. She stands for justice wherever she can and will always try to help people out and protect them, even if it is from themselves and their own thoughts, or in my case protecting me from family members’ bad habits and actions. She talks about equity over equality, and unlike many people who consider feminists to be about just females, she considers it more important that everyone is treated properly, including the other way around where men are put down. She has never made anyone feel less of themselves; an example would be me telling her how I cry in loads of stuff but she never uses anything I say to say I am less of a man. Instead, she is right there to say that that makes me a better person. I will never forget how she talked about the day where women fast for their husbands and how it is not fair and should be vice versa too, and how she ties a string for Happy too.

**Beautiful** – I leave this point to last because she will correctly point out that beauty and art is very subjective. However, she is beautiful, objectively; all of the above shows just how beautiful her soul is. When a soul is this beautiful, of course it will shine through on the outside. Her radiant smile, her wavy hair, her gorgeous eyes – whilst all of those are subjective to people generally, there is no denying that they are all beautified by her character. Anyone who knows her character and personality will automatically see that beauty personified in her features. Her positivity coming through in her smile, her lips open wide showing her mouth. Her lively active side as she laughs and moves her face with her hair waving through the air. Her eyes shining brightly and sparkling whilst simultaneously looking deep into the soul of the person she looks at, silencing them in awe. This is pure, mesmerising beauty.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The only conclusion anyone can get from this is that she’s absolutely amazing. Maybe she doesn’t see a lot of this in herself but I hope by reading this, she does see herself as she should. This is only a summary; there is so much more I could write about each day with her that was an experience of its own. Each day added something to my belief that she was amazing, and I didn’t need to analyse it. I felt it.

She will notice that I grouped a lot of those characteristics together – that isn’t because they are synonyms. Each of those has its own special evidence and meaning, but all of those characteristics are so linked together that they made sense to write together; in fact, every single one of them is linked to each other in some way – it is all one big pot of characteristics that simultaneously totals this special woman, and at the same time doesn’t, because she is so much more than the sum of those.

I know her argument might be that this is all normal and it is what anyone would do, or should do, but all these characteristics in one person still make them amazing. It is not normal at all to be like this and these summaries don’t even go into the depth of how strong each of the characteristics are (or all the ones left unwritten).

No matter what else she has going on, all the above is her personality and will never be lost. She was scared of forgetting who she was and becoming something else, but this will never happen because of this base character, she will always be this person and when she is not this person, she just won’t feel right and will make sure she fights hard to feel right again.

I hope that no matter what is going on, whenever she doesn’t feel good, she can use this to remind her. This is what she is, this and so much more that I can’t even manage to complete anything without remembering more and more and more.

There may be little things here and there that she may not like, she may think her humour is too much or her health is not good at times, or anything else, but it does not change that as a whole person she is truly, truly amazing and that none of those things define her more than the actual person she is.

She is special and a unique combination of naughty and nice, sugar and spice. She is the sunshine to the darkness and happiness to the gloom.

ZambieMama,"My boyfriend became my fiance, and my daughter asked him if he would be her daddy","I posted recently to say how happy I was in my relationship with the guy who has turned my world around, and here I am to update that. He proposed to me before the year ended with his recently deceased grandmother's class ring (it was on a whim, he said if it fit then I had to be the one, and it fit perfectly) and then just yesterday as I was talking to my grandfather about walking me down the aisle with my dad, my daughter asked my FIANCÉ (I throw the word out as often as I can now lol) to be her dad, in which he told her of course. As I began typing this out he adjusted (asleep) in bed and put his arm around me and made a happy little sigh. If you would have asked me a few years ago if I would ever marry or have more children (we have both names picked out when the time comes, Rogelio James or Xiomara Maria) I would have laughed. But here I am with a notebook of wedding ideas, a pinterest board full of our dream wedding, and my AMAZING little wedding planner (who happens to also be my 9yo daughter xD). My life went from constant tears and depressing, anxiety ridden days to happier times and amazing support when the anxiety does get too strong to deal with alone. I used to never want to wake up, but pushed through those thoughts because of my precious daughter.

TennesseeBastard13,A long story about finding happiness and moving on to finally being happy. It is a Love story its my story about my life starting over. feel free to PM me if you have any questions.," 

I was working for a Local prison as a supervisor ""Correctional Sargent"" Back in 2017. Id been married to my Now ex wife for little over a year, and dating for over 4 years. I meet her at a battered woman's shelter and had hit it off. She had trouble keeping any kind of a job but was at the time good company we shared a lot of hobbies ""Spoiler she lied about liking the same things."" Fast forward 3 years I'm making good enough money In my ex wife's state that we agree since she can't handle working ""Anxiety, BPD and ptsd None of that was doctor diagnosed it was self medicated and self diagnosed "" She would become a home maker cooking cleaning and home care .I gave her a New SUV a allowance for her games on steam ""Very Consuming gaming addiction"" We married a court house marriage and things went down hill. She stopped cleaning the house stopped cooking stopped bathing. I worked 12 hours at the prison came home she trashed the house. Her body odor was paint peeling levels. She sat so long in front of the computer unmoving her legs where beginning to break down. I offered her help suggested counseling but she'd throw fits break things threaten to call the police tell them I beat her Threatened to kill her self and leave notes it was my fault if I didn't feed her addictions. No home cooked food ever all take out. She began stealing from me. Lying about paying car insurance making fake insurance cards. I was a fool and stayed through it all. She screamed and me belittled me called me weak smacked me in the face told me it was my fault she treated me this way if I wasn't such a failure she'd be better. She beat me down into a bad place. I spend more and more time at work. Looking for over time. I Went up in rank Became a Sargent ,Weapons team leader, Cell extraction lead ,Sexual assault response team member, Inmate relations board member suicide prevention team and hostage negotiation team. I volunteered for every thing I could to keep me from going home. I got service awards for my "" Dedication"" With all the teams I Joined came a state Laptop for cases and paperwork. She was told the state monitors this laptop don't us it. But when her computer crashed she hopped on mine and the Porn was flowing like a broken dam. Internal affairs asked me if I had a porn addiction when they looked up everything. We fought all the time because I wasn't doing enough for her. Her weight was out of control she had infections from not bathing soaked in her own piss claiming bladder issues ""She just couldn't leave her games and messed her self instead of leaving just a moment."" I came home from work with a broken nose and a cracked orbital bone. She was passed out on the couch, soaked in piss and my state laptop open on face book with a porn hub window open. I picked up my laptop residing my self to clean up the house again and cook me some dinner. But This was the breaking point. Her face book was privet but open she was sexting with some one. Pictures shared with a guy. I looked further. She was meeting men in our small town while i was out for sex in my house in my bed photos galore and videos. she was selling her self for take out even posted prices for sexual acts taco bell 12 pack ten minutes of sex and a blow job. No shit She'd stopped having sex with me a year ago ""not that I wanted to touch her now any more."" I sat out on the front porch smoking my pipe. It was like all the years of abuse hit me at once. I was raised a military brat I can pack and move in 2 hours flat still can today. I Pulled all my money out of the bank account every penny then rented a U-Haul and bought a 12 pack of flash drives Every picture video conversation copied it all. I didn't have to worry about my ex wife waking up she'd been on a gaming binge up 32 hours she's dead to the world for 14-23 hours guaranteed. I loaded everything I personally owned into the U-Haul just tossed my clothes in not bothering to bag them. 1 hour 36 minutes was all it took I left her the bed couch and all the kitchen. I called my Boss explained ""i was going home to Tennessee and I quit thank you for the good times"" He begged me no to leave but I was sick of living up north. I stopped in the city tired bought a bottle of Jack Daniels ""A taste of home"" and proceeded to get drunk in a Denys parking lot at 230 am. I was at that point of drunk when blinking in unison was a difficulty when some one knocked on my window. It was my Pod officer Victoria.

A little about this Officer she was short petite raven black hair in a pixie cut and had sharp facial features every eastern European, Extremely dedicated to her job driven and generally a good fucking person. She was my second in weapons team and also on the sexual assault response team with me. We'd been through a new years riot in a pod and been in countless assault Responses together.

I'm almost black out drunk at this point. and only know what happened because she told me.

""Sargent Anon what are you doing out here?"" She asked pulling on her dogs leash. "" Well I'm currently searching for the bottom of this bottle"" I said taking a long drink. "" Sargent your going to get arrested did some thing happen?"" she asked concerned. ""I'm not your damn Sargent! I quite!!"" I yelled. ""Your not your self Sargent Move over!"" she said opening the cab of the truck shoving me over into the passenger seat. I woke up head splitting on a leather couch in a strange apartment over looking the river. ""Finally join us among the living?"" Victoria asked from a large arm chair."" Creepy Victoria where's my whiskey? There was a quarter bottle left."" I said wandering into her bathroom."" I finished it after I laid you on the couch bout broke my back you heavy ass."" She called from the living room. "" Now I want to know what happened why'd you quit?"" She asked pulling a pillow to her chest. I told her everything and I mean everything. Me and her had a special relationship id often thought what it would have been like to be with her instead. We'd innocently flirted at work my other officers calling her my work wife. She condemned my wife as a fool for loosing me and refused to let me leave with first cooking me breakfast. Waffles bacon coffee and shot of tequila she walked me to my U-Haul my ex wife was now at this point waking up to the note id left her and begun blowing up my phone. I offered her a card with my all my contact info on it. ""If I didn't miss read this between us give me a call or loose the card its your choice."" I told her. She gave me a great big hug holding on to me for a minute before watching me hit the highway for the 10 hour drive back home. My parents where property rich money poor folks but had a one bedroom cabin ready for me on they're property by the time I got there. I spent three weeks in isolation only leaving my cabin to get groceries and speak with my lawyer. I backed my ex into corner with her cheating made out like a bandit. no alimony and she got stuck with court costs. I was free in February 2018.

It was March when my phone rang. It was to my surprise it was Victoria, It had been months. We chatted like we where in high school. It became a daily thing a two three hour conversation after work. Before I knew it I was sitting on my front porch watching her little green geo tracker pulling up my gravel drive. Victoria had taken a two week vacation to come down to visit me. I will never forget seeing her step out of her car. it wasn't how she was dressed not how tight her t shirt was or her jeans it was the look in her eyes and the bright smile. It was like the world fell away. she surprised me. She literally ran up on me grabbing me in a hug. I knew I had to be a sight. I went from clean shaven high and tight hair cut to long brown hair and equally long beard. She playfully grabbed at my beard telling me I was absolutely forbidden to shaven it off. That night we ran to the local store got some ribeye steaks and veggies to cook up and few bottles of cheer. It was still very cool out side so we ended up in my living room curled up on my love seat in front of my fire place watching The princess and frog and a few other Disney Films. It snowed that night. I remember getting up in the middle of the night walking past where Victoria was sleeping on the love seat. She was so small she fit lit like a bed. I sat on the front porch my pipe a glow a wool blanket over my shoulders watching the snow lightly lazy fall. I heard Victoria get up and come to the door. ""I love the smell of your Tobacco "" she said standing in the door way in a over sized t shirt and panties. We made love for the first time in front of my fireplace in the middle of a snow storm. Her visit was over all to soon and she had to return home. Before she left she gave me a long deep kiss. ""Please don't let this be a one time thing."" she said tugging on beard. ""I'm not going anywhere."" I told her hugging her tightly. I sat watching her tail lights fading up my drive way. I Felt happy but also sad and lonely the two weeks we'd spent together where the best I could remember in 5 years.

Its amazing what you change about your self when your in a abusive relationship, The hobbies you forget the things you do differently. I love hunting fishing and camping. Not while married to my ex those things where stupid. But now I sat in my living room building a new tackle box. It felt so good! And Victoria loved fishing and wanted to go camping! She wasn't big on hunting but wanted to try a deer steak. We spoke every night on the phone. She was planning a second trip down so we could spend a week exploring the smoky mountain national park together. We'd planned a few trails to hike together. I had taken a Job a Prison close to where I lived. They were happy to take me with a little bit of pay spike for all my experience. So my income was growing. my Jeep was paid for so bills where low. The time I spent with Victoria the second time was like Christmas morning. We couldn't stop smiling the whole time even when we ran out of water and where famished from thirst on the trail we where happy. The week was ending and we both were sitting on my porch my little fire pit burning throwing pine needles in to the flames. "" I really wish I had longer"" she said looking up at the stairs. ""well why don't you think about staying."" I asked taking her hand. Her eyes where wide choosing her words. ""I would love to but I don't want to be a bother."" She said. smiling at me sadly."" No really think about it. I want you to think about. I want you here. If your willing to leave ........ Behind."" I said. She stud up kissed me before going to the bedroom. I followed. In the morning I watched her leave a second time. It was 3 days later when Victoria and her dog where standing on my front porch. a couple of bags on the front porch. "" If your really serous I want to be here too. but my little one comes too."" She said showing her black and white collie. ""Of course. he's welcome."" Fast forward two years we Married on October 31st 2020. I'm Happy even right now while I type this Victoria is in the other room in the shower. We're trying for our first. I'm still in therapy because of my ex I don't know why i took the abuse so long but I will never be the man I was before. I'm happy. And I hope other men who are in the same situation or going through it can break free your worth more. and can be more. God bless it feels good to share this story.

CrazyDirtyLove,My boyfriend just came to me with a message conversation to help him make a friend.,"I think this is so cute. My boyfriend loves reefing (we have 4 fish tanks right now) and there is someone local who is into the hobby we have met before to swap supplies. My Bf is not from the area so he doesn’t have any friends locally, but he wants to be friends with local fish guy.

There is a forum online where people share advice, talk about random reefing things, and support each other. Local fish guy was giving away some 5 dollar gift cards and my bf won one by choosing the closest number between 1-1,000. Now the last time we saw local fish guy my bf was asking me how he initiates a friendship, but nothing happened (we are both introverts).

Well, he messages local fish guy on the forum and comes upstairs to me every time local fish guy messages back because he wants to say the right thing to be friends.

This just made me happy because he is so pure and there’s so much hope in initiating a friendship. I’m just glad I am his go-to for wording replies to make a friend!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kpdu4a/my_boyfriend_just_came_to_me_with_a_message/,2021-01-03 04:41:15,1,5,0

gforgops,2020 started with me being low-key depressed but the year ended with me being the happiest I've ever been.,"As my country went into lockdown, I was low-key depressed, not able to express my feelings and everything bothered me. I quit social media twice and spent the first couple of months with hardly anyone to talk to, cut off completely from my closest friends and any effort I put into fixing things, was shot down. I lost close family due to the pandemic and had a scare with my mom too. As time went on, I started putting some effort into my physique and started working out everyday. As the lockdown rules were relaxed, I started going out with a friend who again introduced me to her friends and so on. Even though I don't smoke or drink, I spent my evenings at clubs talking to them and having friendly banter, really getting to know these people . One of these friend's offered to host a new year's party at his terrace and spent a month's salary on the alcohol and food for a group of around 15 of us. I had a few shots of Jäger, vodka and champagne and had the best night of my life yet. One of my closest friends sat next to me and kissed me on my cheek while she thanked me for being there for her over the past year and I did the same, it only hit me later that it was the first time I had someone apart from family kiss me and vice versa. Yesterday I hit 4500 skips in about 55 minutes which is my personal best and I wasn't event tired (Idk how good that is). I might be 21, never had a girlfriend but I'm the happiest I've ever been and if I can do it, so can you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kov99s/2020_started_with_me_being_lowkey_depressed_but/,2021-01-02 10:19:15,1,4,0

I thought, wow, to do that, they must feel safe around us because we keep ours open &amp; it's so close like an unspoken language. So, when the holidays rolled around, I decided I would make them a sign. It's a pandemic we can't celebrate with anyone so I wanted to do a random act of kindness. About a week went by, and I opened the window, and they wrote back, the sign says, "" Happy New Year, Neighbor!""  I was so shocked and surprised, and at that moment, I realized what they must have felt like when they saw it. It felt so amazing. They also put so much effort into their sign, and since it took about a week, it looks like they had to buy the poster to do that. Just so thoughtful.

blinkrandom,He told me he loved me for the first time,"I've had a string of failed relationships. Men who have cheated on me; have used me for sex; have gaslighted me; have left me feeling undesired or unwanted; or have goaded me into telling them I loved them when I wasn't ready. I attracted a lot of interest, but couldn't keep anyone for long. Remained single for over three years, learned to love myself again and was content being alone. 

Then I met H. 

We've been dating since October, a couple of days before my 29th birthday. Everything has felt effortless with him. He's made me feel so loved and happy. My life was fine before him, but now that he's in it, I couldn't imagine my life without him. And last night when we were cuddling in bed, he told me he loved me for the first time. And I didn't feel panicked or rushed, or any kind of dread that this man was going to hurt me like I have in my last few relationships. Instead I had the biggest, goofiest grin on my face, and I told him I loved him too. And I really meant it.

I have nobody else in my life to share this with, so I wanted to share it here!

chikkenfinners,Was having a bad day and my boyfriend turned it into something lovely.,"So I didn't know where to post this but it made me so happy I cried when I came home from work yesterday. 


I got stuck at work when an coworker called in about two hours before my shift was over. I was kind of stressed since I had chores at home and I start feeling overwhelmed whenever I know my place is dirty so I let my boyfriend know I would be home later than usual since I gave him the keys to my apartment that morning so he could sleep in. He told me it would all be okay and not to worry about it too much.

Fast forward to the end of my shift.. I ended up getting home later than usual because it was snowing and I just felt like I could throw myself on the bed and pass out on the spot. I get through the door and I was greeted with a big smush of a hug and a forehead kiss. I noticed that my boyfriend had cleaned everything I was worried about. Like everything. I didn't even tell him anything that I needed to take care of. He took out the trash (because tbh I'm very bad at that and I had a bunch of big boxes as well from Christmas and cute target furniture I bought on impulse) and made me dinner. He even made my bed just how I do and brought over his guitar so we could practice together because I bought one recently and I need help since I don't know what the heck I'm doing. 

He laid my pajamas out for me and told me to go take a long hot shower and just asked me to relax because I don't need to worry about anything. 

I've never cried from happiness so much and that was the sweetest and most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me. It happened just last night and I'm still thinking about it and I dont know what I did to deserve such a beautiful man that never fails to remind me that we're always a team. 

I'm sorry if it's a little choppy or poorly worded I'm on mobile. But there's always something to smile about and this was a big one for me. Thanks for reading! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kn79sb/was_having_a_bad_day_and_my_boyfriend_turned_it/,2020-12-30 18:06:39,1,6,0

Actual-Mode9230,Made some positive changes the last few weeks,"I'm a bit of a gaming and internet addict. Always been a big nerd when it comes to that stuff. I'm currently a stay at home dad with my one year old son and have been contemplating how to be a better person. Looking into his beautiful brown eyes fills me with hope and courage to be better.

Having my son has made me finally take a few steps to be a better human overall. I finally sold off my video game collection. My possessions had grown quite large and was becoming stifling. Its funny how stuff in a closet can add mental stress and take up your free thoughts fretting over them. It actually became a point of contention between me and my ex years ago.

I finally sold it all off and feel more uplifted. It's bittersweet for a few items but mostly, i don't notice. What i do notice is the clarity in my head. No more negative thoughts over how to preserve and hoard my junk. I also took the liberty of putting the money into our son's saving account. Added a few thousand so im highly proud of that.

I'm taking further effort to try and reduce my screen time. If i want to raise my son to be social media free and to not have an addiction to screens, it has to start with me. I picked up reading books to fill some of my time. It was a little tough at first but i've completed two books now. I'm a bit of a slow reader so i'll never be able to compete with my wife, but it has brought a lot of serenity to me. The peaceful escape into a story is more relaxing and liberating than i first believed it could be. Its now become a regular part of my life.

When covid is finally over, i plan on reaching into some more social activities like casual lunches with friends or taking martial arts classes or something. I just wanted to come here and gush about how making some changes truly can start a positive trend. I feel very happy and wholesome right now and wanted to share some of that with you all.

I met someone who helped me see my potential and I found my calling and went to school for it. Its a lucrative career choice and I have done quite well. I love what I do. I feel like what I do energizes and fulfills me and I am finally moving out on my own to a large city. Something Ive often dreamed about. I found a really nice apartment and I am excited for the change. Never in my life have I not felt a sense of dread when I think about my future. I have a long ways to go and many things I still need to work on, but I finally feel like I am going in the direction, the direction I want, and I am suppose to be moving in. I just wanted to share this. Its a new chapter, a really a big new chapter. I think that in the past I thought that I was making big changes, but nothing like this. Nothing so profound.

N3wStartAtLyfe,"I ran a 9’30” mile for the first time ever! I’ve always been a “bad” runner, but I started to enjoy running and run consistently about 3 years ago. This is the first time I’ve felt like I’m making progress.","I know this isn’t a super impressive time. This wasn’t like, an all-out run, I was trying to be “reasonable” and push myself but still be able to maintain my breathing and run the whole time. When I was a kid in school and ran the mile I averaged like 10-11minutes. I think the fastest I ever got was maybe 9’50” and that was with me running as hard as I could and literally collapsing and hyperventilating at the end of the run. I’m now 24 and still have terrible lung capacity and breathing (doctor thinks I have exercise induced asthma but didn’t do a test specifically for it, plus I have chronic sinus problems so breathing even when I’m not running is a struggle.)

I always hated running, even though I was athletic in other ways (I used to figure skate and do gymnastics). I started running about 3 years ago after several failed attempts and something finally clicked and running became my stress relief and meditation. I haven’t run super consistently- usually 2-3x a week, skipping a week here or there. I finally learned how to pace myself better earlier this year and have run (very slowly) for 30 min straight for the first time in my life.

Yesterday was the first time I’ve tracked my time for a mile since running more consistently and I was thrilled to see that I ran a better time than I ever have in my life at a reasonable level of exertion. Especially because I’m struggling with some other health issues (lost a ton of weight due to anxiety and stuff this past year, and I was on the slim side of normal to start, and I can’t seem to gain the weight back.)

It makes me hopefully my runs will keep improving as I be more consistent and work on the rest of my health",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/km7tmv/i_ran_a_930_mile_for_the_first_time_ever_ive/,2020-12-29 05:17:00,1,4,0

I kept losing jobs over it. She gave my daughter coke at one point and time said it would “help with the teething”... (looking back now I should have left then and hate myself that I didn’t but that’s a whole other can of worms) anyway I knew I wasn’t happy and knew I deserved better and I finally walked away in March. I had nothing. Me and my daughter were homeless. Staying on friends couches. I had a good friend who helped me get through this toxic mess of my life. He was wonderful and nothing I was used to, because let’s be honest anything was better then what I was just with. So we kinda started talking and I went to see him few times and I came to a realization that he just wasn’t what I wanted as my partner. I’ve worked so hard on myself that I was gunna stand up for what I wanted out of life because I had been pushed around so much in my previous relationship and in life in general, i knew if it wasn’t what I wanted it would just destroy me in the end. So I ended it. So in the mean time in July I moved in with my grandparents to get on my feet. I’ve had a job (the same one) for 6 months, I’ve bought a new car and I know what I want out of life and if you don’t like it you know where the door is. I’ve worked too damn hard to be pushed around again. So a guy I had friendzoned, who I’ve known for over a year has been helping me through everything. Well come to find out he’s everything I’ve been wanting and then more. I’ve been hurt in the past and have lots of guards up but with him it is the easiest thing I’ve ever had to do. He’s becoming my best friend and I think I’m starting to fall for him. Like hard. And it’s scary so I’m going slow making super sure it’s what I want for me and my daughter. Also my daughter had the absolute best Christmas. Last year, I was still in the toxic relationship, and she took my money for Christmas and spent it on coke so I had to wrap old toys for my daughter and put them under the tree. The tree was just a string of lights on the wall in the shape of a tree. It was heartbreaking. And now this year she had an actual tree, with actual presents and she was so excited and to see her face and I had a few meltdowns because I can’t believe how far I’ve come. I’m moving back to my hometown in April and I’ll finally be able to have my own place for me and my daughter and I just really wanted to share this because I wanted to feel validated by Reddit 😂 (still something I’m working on daily)",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/klll2t/one_of_the_best_years_of_my_life_and_its_only/,2020-12-28 07:09:03,1,3,0

NightSymphny,My brother(12) gave $75 of his birthday money to the police and something wonderful happened,"Hello all. I'd like to tell a story about some good cops that I interacted with.

So my brother (12) has always loved first responders. Firefighters, Police, Paramedics, etc. This September, my brother donated his $75 of birthday money to our local police department. He was hoping they would do something good with the money (not just buy guns or some shit) because it was all of his birthday money. So the cops decided that they would buy a bunch of stuffed animals for kids who had to come down to the police station after traumatic incidents. The police also were super thankful that he donated the money, so my family got to take a tour of the police station and see the stuffed animals that he helped buy. Thought I'd share this because it always gives me warm fuzzies inside when I think about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kldmbp/my_brother12_gave_75_of_his_birthday_money_to_the/,2020-12-27 23:03:04,1,4,0
Grand_Pick8070,Embracing mediocrity and the decision to be happy above all else.,"I have a difficult job, my wife and I moved across the country a few years back to redress the work life balance. Didn’t really work for me, but I was able to support her to stay home and raise our children which was great.

I worked, paid the bills to buy new stuff, did a little of what I love (being with family) and a lot of what I didn’t (work). Got promoted a few times, etcetera etcetera.

I wasn’t happy, I wasn’t unhappy I was just trying to get on.

I know it sounds twee, but recently (and maybe the dirge that is 2020 has something to do with it) I had a bit of an existential awakening.

I moved across the country for a better life and ended up just doing the stuff that made me miserable with a different view out of the window.

Thing is, it didn’t end up being complicated. I love my kids and my wife. I don’t need any more stuff, or a better car, or a bigger house, I don’t need to spend cash on crap I don’t need to fill a void I don’t have.

So I’ve redirected myself. I’ll go to work and do my job as best as I can, because having pride in what you do is important. But. When I come home the only thing I want to do is be with my family, not spend time on the phone re work. If I don’t get promoted anymore, so what. Why do I crave the accolades and approval of people who I care nothing for, nor them me.

So, it may be simple and may even seem like a anticlimax if you’ve read the above, but if it helps anyone, focus on what you have, not what you think you ought to. I’ve chosen to be content with my work, invest myself fully at home and let myself be content.

I’m not the most articulate and I’m sure the above could be said better, but change where you think you want to go. Happiness is the destination.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/klddpw/embracing_mediocrity_and_the_decision_to_be_happy/,2020-12-27 22:49:58,1,6,0
ZambieMama,"I am in love, happy, and lucky to have a wonderful man that wants to complete our beautiful family, be a daddy to my beautiful daughter, and make her a big sister","My boyfriend and I have known each other for about 4 years. We met at work and our boss at the time told him to look after me when I first started working there. She no longer works with us, but to this day he still is following her order. I have had bad relationships in the past, but now I am with a man who loves me and my daughter unconditionally, and I can finally say I'm truly the happiest I have ever been. My daughter mentioned if we were to get married, she would be his daughter, and without hesitation he told her she already was. He attends parent teach conferences with me, helps her with homework, and makes her feel so well loved. We are talking babies and marriage now with so much excitement, and if you would have asked me if either would happen before meeting him, I would have laughed. Prior to meeting I was also depressed and anxious to the point of losing myself, but these past couple months of our relationship (over a year long with many more to come) I have felt a sudden sense of peace and happiness. This man made me realize I am capable of anything, that parenting doesn't mean I do it alone, and best of all he helped me find God.

I grew up in an abusive home and was sexual assaulted, abused physically at 4 years up to 16 years of age. I'm 21 now and I'm not gonna let my abuser take me down. I'm a grown man and I'm gonna live my life like every day is the last.

You gotta conquer the day! Like a warrior. I have the mindset of a soldier. I'll never give up and I'll keep pushing till the day I croak. I used to skinny as hell but I've been working out hardcore and got buffed up.

Loving yourself is Key to true happiness. Life is precious and I'll enjoy every second for now on! You can all be happy! Be confident and dont care what other people think. Make the world see that you are capable of doing anything!

saarshai,Finally doing what makes me happy by counting my blessings,"I'm a creative type, which might sound great but it's not... Being too creative can also mean lack of focus and follow-through. It can mean chasing that new shiny thing and not sticking to what I truly is my purpose in life.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done many things that seemed like a good idea. At some of them I was quite successful, but most of them a failure, and almost all of them didn't really bring me lasting happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that I always noticed I'm doing is obsessively envying and comparing - Why can't I have this or that? Why am I not earning enough, like him or her? Which also meant that I've done many things out of the wrong reasons - prestige and financial reward.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been searching for a new path for years now, and yesterday I started something that truly feels me with joy. Whether it succeeds or not - that's yet to be seen, but it does make me happy, and maybe that's what's most important.

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically, that thing is about combating my natural envy by writing about everything I'm actually rich with - things that I should just spend more time appreciating rather than chasing what I think I want.

sarahms89,"I am beyond blessed this year, and I needed to say it somewhere more anonymous than my social media!","This year has been so hard for so many people, that to be honest, I feel kinda guilty saying just how amazing this year has been for me.  But 2020 has been just...an incredible year in my life.

First off, I was officially hired by a company I started working with through a temp agency.  I'm now their marketing director, and love this company, the people that own and run it, and the people I get to work with on a daily basis.  This place has been incredibly accommodating as I've made a bunch of other super positive changes in my life, and the owner is so supportive of me and and my work that it's been such an incredible pleasure to be part of this place.  For the first time ever, I can imagine working somewhere until I retire, and it will definitely be this place!

Second, I and my partner worked hard on our relationship to make it stronger than ever.  My fiancee is absolutely amazing and I love her so much!  We've had some serious rocky times, but now we're finally reaching a good stable point in our life together, and in our respective personal lives.  I can't imagine my life without her, and it feels so amazing to love someone so completely who returns that same love and devotion!

Third, I bought a house!!  It's a perfect starter home, and yes, I'm TOTALLY bragging about it!  2 bed, 2 bath, with an attached 2 car garage and a detatched workshop with 1.5 acres of land, all fenced in, and they even put a brand new 30-year roof on it right before closing.  I can't get over how lucky I feel about that, and I'm still basking in the glow of new home ownership.  It's insane!

Fourth, definitely not least, but I started taking better care of my mental health, which is definitely what contributed to a lot of the great things that happened this year.  I'm getting my bipolar disorder taken care of, and I'm finally sleeping longer than 4 hours a night for the first time in years.  Please, if you're struggling with anxiety, mental health problems, sleeplessness, just anything that contributes to you not feeling your best, PLEASE go see someone!  Get the help you need, and I promise you'll see improvements in other areas of your life.  Maybe not immediately, but at least you'll be more clear-headed and feel better.  Life is so beautiful, and you deserve to have it!

And finally, my finances are finally - incredibly - in a position where I was ABLE to buy a house!  Money in savings, working on rebuilding my 401k, my small business on the side has grown a lot, and I'm just...I'm feeling so incredibly blessed and feel like all of the hardships in my life helped me get to this point.  I know there's still a long, long way to go, and that things can always go wrong, but I'm choosing to focus on the good right now.  I just feel stable for the first time in my entire life, like I can finally breathe a little, and I've never felt like that, so I'm just going to soak it up!

I'm sorry this was so long.  Usually at the end of each year, I look back and get upset at how much I didn't accomplish, or I look forward at all of the hurdles ahead of me.  It's such a change to feel like I have things to actually want to happen, and to actually look at the previous year as the Year I Got Shit Done.

redbloodywedding,The Internet is AWESOME! And Reddit is full of helpful advice!,"No videos, or pictures. But I just wanted to quickly remind everyone that the Internet is AWESOME. I've asked multiple questions on Reddit throughout the years. From Fitness, to relationship advice. From specific questions about certain gear I'm working with. I'm always blessed with an answer that leads me in the right direction. Pretty much almost anything you could ask for the internet has the answer. And specifically Reddit is surprisingly awesome to get real answers from real people without any BS sales thrown down your throat. Maybe some thots, or somebody posting a post just to bring traffic to their blog but even then there's some uhhhhh valuable content to be had ;)

Any who I've been personally depressed and down after a breakup. But it's so nice to know there's genuinely awesome people out there willing to offer help to an anonymous stranger. And I'm hoping to pay it forward and just make the world THAT much better.

Occams-_-Chainsaw,Today random strangers on reddit were able to give my family a Christmas. My family has been happy crying since.,"today the kindness of strangers had me in tears.
So This has been the worst year of my life and my entire family's lives also. We couldnt have Thanksgiving due to money and all of us having covid and my father being in the hospital for his extreme case. He was laid off because of the virus and my mother couldnt work for 6 weeks while she had it. On top of this i am disabled, terminal, and usually bedridden so i couldnt work to help out. 
We were about to file for bankruptcy and then a few days ago the main sewer line under our house burst so we cant use anything. It has gotten so bad my family has legitimately been debating committing group Suicide.
So i made a post on r/trueoffmychest just trying to vent and several strangers gave very kind words and then some even offered to send money to help my family out. Complete strangers just allowed my family to have a nice Christmas meal now. There are some truly amazing people out there and their kindness gave my family a little bit of hope.

 Strangers provided us a light in a very dark year/life

Lee63225,After 4 years on reddit it's time to say thank you!,"Hello redditors!
4 years ago on this day I joined this community. I needed some time to get the grip and understand how everything works. I saw many negative things, I saw racism, I saw negative comments and hate speech. I saw people fighting and blaming each other and saw things I should not have seen.

But eventually I learned that the digital world is like the real world. You have to choose the paths you take and you decide which people you keep in your life.

Reddit is also like this. You can spend time fighting with people, you can participate in controversial topics or try to change the minds of other redditors.

Or you can just enjoy the positive communities, you can focus on the wholesome comments and posts, you can use reddit to be up to date on the latest things or even to find new friends! You can join communities that remind you of the important things in life.

In these 4 years I met people that were dying and spend some of their last moments with me, found new friends I am still gaming with, learned many life hacks and historical facts and cried and laughed more than thought I would.

But the most valuable lesson I learned is that it does not matter where you are from, how old you are or how rich you are. Every human has a story that made him what he is now. Some people are lucky, some did not have the chance to experience the good moments we had. Some people took a wrong turn on the highway called life that led them to negative things they did, to a unfortunate future.

But all in all what is most important is to respect each other and be grateful for what you have, even if it is not much.

I wish you all a better future, a healthy and happy one! I am grateful for all the good moments. Thank you reddit!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kh2dv7/after_4_years_on_reddit_its_time_to_say_thank_you/,2020-12-20 21:08:56,1,3,0

Alabaster_Canary,My three year old nephew tried on my shoes today,"I'm not a parent but I have a little nephew who is THE BEST. Only problem is he hates me! When I sit down next to him, he calmly instructs me to move. When I talk to him, he firmly suggests that I stop. When i call him bubba, he patiently reminds me of his christian name.


This toddler is made of stone.


But I've been working on this little brat, it only took him a year and a half to say my name, and today, for whatever reason, we had a breakthrough. Weirdly, it was my high heeled shoes.


My family is kind of natural, and I must be the only person he knows who wears clackity heels, and he heard me clacking across the floor and asked to try on my 'boots.'


We sat down and tried to put them on but stepping into them worked better. It was a detailed extravaganza, but 'THEY'RE TOO BIG.' Yep, told ya! So then we put all his toy snakes inside them instead.


But the real happy is that my strict fundy christian family didn't say a damn thing because THEY'RE JUST SHOES, and we were having a great time, and he learned high heeled maryjanes just aren't his style.

razzle_dazzled,Gratitude post: I have been treated extremely well by nearly everyone in my life so far,"I’ll start this off with one caveat: Like many, many people, I had a pretty chaotic and traumatic home life growing up. I was sensitive and suffered a lot during those years due to what I experienced and witnessed. 

However, unlike many people I know, other than my home life (and I’m 24 now), I have been blessed with a seemingly endless litany of kind, helpful and nurturing people: friends, teachers, tennis partners, professors, bosses, therapists, doctors, boyfriends, coworkers, college deans, host families, even strangers ... My interactions with other humans have been, as a whole, almost *eerily* positive.

People throughout my life have been almost always gentle, encouraging and patient with me, have bent over backwards to help me, have been shown so much grace and mercy and compassion. I have been well loved and liked and praised. I have never struggled to make friends, or to attract a long term partner, or to endear myself to bosses, teachers or mentors. I have never felt unwanted by my friends. 

Of course so so much of this is due to my privilege, being a relatively attractive, educated white woman. I hear and read so many stories, on Reddit and in real life, about the trials of others, who are unfairly and routinely mistreated and betrayed by their friends, partners, colleagues, colleges, bosses, by their communities and by their governments. 

I feel so grateful and almost flabbergasted by my blessing. I think through all of the important people people and connections I have made during my life and I can see how I have only ever been protected, encouraged, accommodated and, on the rare occasion I have been mistreated, I have been promptly apologized to. And I have broken so many rules, made so many mistakes, been reckless and naive and trusting, opening myself up over and over again to potential abuse, manipulation and betrayal. Yet somehow I have been spared! 

This is all quite strange for me to be saying. I have not felt lucky. Life itself has been quite difficult for me. I have been severely troubled and distressed and burnt out and self-loathing. But I suddenly realize that not once has it been because of other people. In the contrary. My biggest battle has always been been myself. And it has been constant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kgcxj2/gratitude_post_i_have_been_treated_extremely_well/,2020-12-19 18:14:10,1,3,0

So today, I am holding myself accountable to that responsibility by writing in my journal...a healthy way to get my feelings on paper and process some of the pain and grief I’m struggling with. On days like this, giving myself small goals that I can achieve are key. They may not be what I wanted to achieve, but life is all about adapting with change and riding the ebbs and flows. As much as we plan and think we have control over our lives, there are always going to be challenges thrown our way. Losing expectations and letting go of that control allows me to adapt to those challenges, even when they are persistent.

fuzziepeache,"Today I got a surgery done on my knee for a bucket handle tear, and it was the absolute best day of my life because of the amazing nurses and my overwhelmingly loving family and friends. Now I am in recovery and really begin planning for my future!🥺❤️","Today I had surgery on my knee, I had a bucket handle tear and was dealing with it for nearly 4 years at this point and the injury had happened 4 times. It was never a negative experience it was just very confusing as I never got it diagnosed. I got it again four months ago and it hadn’t gone away. So me and mum decided to go to a chiropractor and it got finally diagnosed as a bucket handle tear. He was an incredible chiropractor and gave me the biggest hope for my full recovery. After that I got my MRI and he was correct and the only way to fix it was through surgery. Today I got that surgery with an incredible doctor who genuinely cared and took the utmost care with me. However I felt so grateful to all of the out of this world nurses who took care of me all day. I made sure to tell them how incredible and kind they really were thanking them at every turn. I made sure to smile and be very positive because this was legitimately the best day of my life. I’m not that old (17f) and through the love and support of everyone I love I am the happiest and most grateful I’ve ever been. I’m a very emotional person and I’m very proud of that and all throughout the day I was crying but it was never sad tears. Even now I’m crying while writing this and it’s nothing but joy. Today made me realize how positivIty and love are the most powerful things ever. The first person I thought of when I woke up was my best friend and my favourite person on the planet. Since I was already crying because I saw my very close family friend and burst into tears seeing her, even just the thought of my best friend made me bawl. I truly do love her so much, and even though she’s not my partner she’s pretty much the love of my life (best friends are just as important as romantic ones, just thought I would mention that 😂). I honestly can’t wait till I’m all healed up and COVID is over enough so I can hug her. Once I had woken up from my surgery they told me the amazing news that they could repair the muscle instead of removing it, which was what they expected to have to do because of how long and how many times I had it. No matter the outcome I will forever be grateful to everyone at the hospital and everyone in my life and outside of it. It will be a long road to recovery but I’ve never been so excited in my entire life. Who would have every guessed how overwhelming happy I would be to have my leg actually be straight hahaha. Thank you to anyone who has read this and I hope you have and amazing day/night/afternoon!

Also here is the website with contact and other information [https://happyer4life.com/](https://happyer4life.com/)

If you care about why I made it: So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. So I just started noting what activities I did and who I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. This is what led the idea of this app.

UberPenthal,"I have waited 6 years to begin this process and it's been one of the sole things on my mind, and now I've reached the 1 month milestone on hormones!","I learnt that I was transgender (Male-To-Female) when I was 11 years old, before that realization I had felt that something was inherently wrong with me but I had no idea what it was. 
 It was honestly a terrifying time for me and that identity crisis brought up so many concerns and worries that manifested in a depression that lasted through my male puberty. 
I began to loathe myself and well... 
The revelation that hit me today, hit me like a very pleasant truck. 
I haven't had a suicidal, self-harming or self-loathing thought in over 6 months now. I'm genuinely happy for what feels like the first time in my life. Getting up each morning doesn't feel like a chore anymore, and taking care of my mind and body feels so much more attainable. 

I know I'm only 17, and the 'real' struggles in life, I've yet to face, but my struggle here taught me ALOT that I'm sure will allow me to handle those struggles without falling apart like I've done so often in the past.

Today I'm getting two little cupcakes, and a prego from my local bakery to celebrate. My heart is filled with love, and emotion and that's something I was missing for far too long. 

I just needed to share this, I think. ^^

Aurie37,My dad is being more health conscience and I couldn't be more proud of him,"My dad was diagnosed with COPD this summer and it really hit me hard when I found out. He's been on a CPAP machine for some years now was prescribed breathing treatments and an inhaler before switching to a new doctor and being tested. He'd been having breathing problems since last winter and the rest of the family and I have been really concerned about it. He's never been one to go to the doctor much or seek medical treatment when he probably should. He's been overweight most of his life and worked a career for nearly 30 years that has a low life expectancy due to stress related health issues. 

 I wouldn't say I have a favorite parent, but I did have a nightmare when I was a teenager where my dad had passed away and now the thought of losing my dad has been one of my biggest fears. I've cried about it occasionally and really only talked to my husband about that concern. I've dealt with that fear haunting me for over 10 years. 

Over the past 4 months, he's started a new medication for his COPD and has been eating healthier. He's lost 80lbs and has had noticeable changes in the activities he can handle. Just a few months ago, he couldn't catch his breath and almost passed out after moving mattress to their basement and would have to to take breaks to use his inhaler while mowing the lawn. It was almost to the point I considered buying him a riding mower next year if he didn't get himself one. Now we don't have to worry about him using the push mower and he's able to move furniture and play with my kids. He often volunteers to take care of things more too, like taking the grandkids or dog outside to to play. He even brought over a ladder to my house and helped my husband clean out the gutters just because I asked him what was causing the stains on our ceilings on one side of the house. Turns out the downspouts were clogged and causing water to back up into the eaves. Months ago, we would just borrow the ladder and my husband would take care of it. This time he just showed up one afternoon and started working on it during his lunch break. He probably would've done the whole thing if he didn't have to get back to work(even after retirement, he still likes to have a job.) My husband ended up finishing the task so my dad could come by later and pick up the ladder. I'm just really excited to see my dad doing so well now and feel like he's a lot like he used to be when I was a kid and he would teach me how to swing a bat and how to catch and throw a baseball or football. I'd bug him to play catch with me when he'd get home from work or on his days off. I also grew up being his fishing buddy and spent a lot of quality time with him. He's someone I've looked up to my entire life and is the reason for my strong work ethic. He's always taken such great care of the family and taught me the most about finances, credit, and other life skills and I honestly don't think I could be as far in life without his guidance and help when I've struggled to get back up on my feet. 

When he first told me about his COPD, I was afraid of losing him sooner than I ever thought and that he wouldn't get to see his grandkids graduate high school. Seeing his improvement gives me hope that we'll still have him around much longer now and my kids will have an awesome childhood full of wonderful memories with their grandpa. Plenty of fishing trips, baseball practice, and life skills lessons for my kids for years to come. Being a dad has always brought him joy and now he's got more energy to keep up with the grandkids. I'm just so proud of him and am happy to see how well he's doing now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/keoo71/my_dad_is_being_more_health_conscience_and_i/,2020-12-17 02:53:13,1,2,0

yellingsnowloaf,"I pretty much got my dream job! After being unemployed since March and deciding to make a career change, this is truly epic.","I was working in aircraft as a quality inspector and it was ok. Everyday was drilled into us that we're only there to save the company money by not approving faulty products instead of keeping people safe. The same job at another company told us over and over that quality control is just a formality and they'd have the machinists check their own parts and fire us all if they could because cost so much. 

I hated knowing that the main reason I work and make my life super stressful for their schedules was to help some billionaire profit more. 

Months before I got laid off, I decided that I wanted to make a career change and started working towards it. Getting laid off and then covid ruining the aircraft industry for the near future definitely wrre the final nails in the coffin. 

I just got a call that my final interview is next week. This interview is just to make sure that leadership likes me. Piece of cake. I'm all but hired, no one has ever gotten this far and then been denied. I won't be cocky or arrogant, I'll still do my absolute best to make sure I get this.

SpeakMySecretName,I stood up for myself and it worked out!,"Job Quitting and Job Finding stories are probably overdone here, but I’m too happy not to share. 

I was working at a place where I wasn’t treated very well. My boss was asking me to work sometimes 10- 20 hours unpaid a week on top of my salaried 40 hours. A lot of people were laid off and I had to fill roles I wasn’t trained for. I would get calls after midnight to come into work and if I was asleep and missed it, I’d get publicly shamed for it at work. I was promised a temporary salary as I learned the software, but eventually I was the only person left on the team and still the raise never came. -then the final straw, my paychecks stopped coming in. 

I texted and emailed my boss several times before he finally got the small company together and said that some people have to skip their checks because I want to be paid and there isn’t enough money for everyone. 

Ridiculous right? 

This was a job that I desperately needed. I needed it to get into my industry, and to build my portfolio. I felt so lucky when I finally landed it because so many people in my industry are out of work. So it was terrifying when I told my boss that nobody has to skip their checks, I’m quitting and finding my new salary. 

As I spend the last month and half applying to hundreds of places, I began to worry that I had made a mistake and I might not be able to find work before my bills caught up. But in the same week, last week, I got 3 interviews. I took all of them to the third round and this morning I got my first offer!

It is almost double what my last job paid me, plus benefits I didn’t have before like insurance and PTO! I’m so glad I stopped letting myself get bullied by my work. I’m so glad I had a fiancé that encouraged me to find better. I’m so relieved that everything will work out.

Out of nowhere he texts me, “You know. We Love ❤️ You. That’s we call Family.” (He’s a boater btw)

It might be because I’m moving away soon, I’m not sure. I ugly cried for a little bit before texting back, “I love you guys too.” Then I ugly cried a little bit more. After I finally got over my embarrassment, I drove home and got laughed at because of my runny makeup. The text messages were never brought up.

SUDoKu-Na,Me and my family have come so far in a year!,"tl;dr Me and my family are better off in every way than we were a year ago and couldn't be happier!

A year ago me and my family (sister, father, myself) weren't in a great spot. Now, only a year later, we're so happy all the time. We were struggling to find any house that would take us for reasons outside our control, and we took a place that was above what we could afford or else we were; now we are comfortable as when it comes to housing and money, and between the three of us we have money to spare. My father could stop working if he wanted to and we could live comfortably; we can go on shopping sprees if we want, and we have enough money to buy luxuries like snacks and ice creams when we go shopping. We can buy a cake just for the heck of it!

We got rid of some toxic relatives in our lives (though they are still a more distant part), and now we can wake up on our own schedules, work permitting. We haven't so much as heard angry yelling in months, and we are always just peaceful and civil. The neighbours are fantastic, too, and we don't have to worry about anybody that might be around the house anymore! We're so comfortable we can sleep with the front door open (though with the screen door locked and shut).

This past year the biggest things we've had to stress about are: 1. we once locked ourselves out of the house, and 2. we don't know when our cat toys are being delivered (we got a cat!)

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies for the aimless post I'm just so happy and excited about how far we've come in a year.

N3wStartAtLyfe,"I actually did well in my classes this semester, despite online learning and my mental health. At the start of the semester I was considering dropping out because I couldn’t keep up with the material.","I’m in my second year of a very challenging grad program, and online learning was *hard*. I’m severely ADHD, unmedicated, and have 0 internal motivation to study. More than half the semester I did nothing (I would try to watch the zoom lectures but just zone out and get nothing from it, so I eventually stopped attending lectures and tried to just read the notes on my own time). Mostly I just crammed before each exam. This particular semester is known in my program to be the *worst* semester workload/difficulty-wise.

I got better grades this semester than I have the previous 2 semesters. (except for one class but that was in a subject that I have zero interest in; making it almost impossible for my adhd brain to focus on it or remember anything about it, and so I was just happy to pass). I ended with 4 As, 2 Bs, and just the one C (which I had almost pulled up to a B- impressive considering I borderline failed the midterm). I know grades aren’t necessarily that important, but at the beginning of the semester I was so far behind I actually contacted my advisor about dropping out or taking a leave of absence because I couldn’t handle distance learning and was convinced I was going to flunk out. To not only pass but do *well* is so incredible, because I always feel like I’m not good enough to be in this program.

I can’t really talk about this to my friends in my program, because I know they didn’t do as well (and they actually attended classes, unlike me) so I don’t want to celebrate and upset them.

NotObamasClone,I bought a loved one an awesome xmas gift and I haven’t been this happy or excited in a long time.,"It’s been a rough year for everyone but especially for my mom. Not long after covid started appearing in the US she was diagnosed with brain cancer. She’s had surgery, chemo and is doing very well all things considered. She’s pretty much recovered and is now doing the consistent checks and doctors appointments and tests, which have all been coming back good. 

Both of my parents are retired, social security, disability, etc. fixed income sort of situation. Not much to spend on frivolous things. I’m (30m) an entry level insurance rep for a speciality pharmacy and make decent enough money for a single guy living with his dog, not much but enough. Only been working this position for about a year, which gave me a raise of about $3-$4/hour. 

This year I had managed to save a little more than $1000 and was thinking about how I wanted to spend it. My mom loves Rift, I got her to make a WoW account when I was 12 and she’s been into MMORPGs ever since. It’s been years since she’s been able to play because gaming computers can be expensive and her last one died. 

My dad and I went to bestbuy today after I finally decided what I wanted to get. So I got my mom a asus gaming laptop with 16gb ram, gtx 1660ti &amp; intel core i7. It’s not the best of the best but it will run the shit out of Rift. 

I’m so excited for Christmas now. I wanted to give it to her today but asked if she wanted her gift now or on xmas and she decided to wait. Now I have to hold onto this thing for two weeks and its killing me lmao. 

Seriously, I haven’t been this happy in a long time or excited for future plans and I just can’t freaking wait for her to open it!

Say_Sprinkles,"I Got My First Full-Time Job After 8 Months of Searching, A Lot of Patience, And Tears","I graduated in May from college with a BFA in graphic design. As all of you know, due to Covid, no one was really hiring.

I had two job offers at the beginning of March. The place I worked at as a student asked me to be full-time after I graduated and there was another offer at a local T-shirt company of where my friend worked at. Due to how everyone was new to handling COVID, there were a lot of budget cuts and I was laid off from my student job. They couldn’t afford another full-time person either. The t-shirt company that my friend worked at had to furlough their staff and almost went bankrupt. They too, couldn’t afford another full timer.

I was suddenly back at square one.

After 8 months of searching, I’ve finally landed my first entry-level job! On top of that, it’s in a large marketing and advertising agency - which never really happens for someone who is very fresh like me.

Someone that I knew, who graduated before I did, posted a job opening at her work, and I immediately asked her how I could apply. She gave a very excellent recommendation for me and I got the interviews and was given a job offer. 

For months, I was anxious, sad, and I felt completely worthless.

I was extremely lost.

I had this cloud over my head and I regretted rejecting another graphic design job offer two months ago that had low pay and barely any starting benefits. I knew the job really sucked too due to people I know that worked there.

In the back of my mind, something told me not to take it. I thought to myself that I could find a better job. Super risky move in these pandemic times and my student loan payments were about to kick in, but I was set on doing something better for myself. Either create my small business or get a job. 

Now, I can work from home, get paid +$10,000 more than the other job offer plus with more benefits, and I actually get work that can actually be put in my portfolio for my own professional development.

To those, who are struggling with finding a new job, it might take a long time until you find what you’re looking for. In the moment, it seems like a pipe dream and you feel like you’ll never get there. But I guess as the saying goes, good things will come to those who wait.

Well I guess we have already been friends for a long time but we haven't talked too much since highschool. I am pretty good at making friends but I've only had like 2 others in my whole life.  Kinda a thought dump but thinking about it is making my night.

After losing my job and doing covid gigs outside my major (still am), I started playing more video games.. then warzone dropped. He saw me on and we found out he and another dude (who I met a hand full of times in the past) were all really good. During the lockdowns we'd play near half our days away catching Ws. 

Then i got invited to the group chat after a couple months of this. Quickly after me and the aquantiances guy started hanging without my main bud. Even went to his birthday party back home and drank with his party friends. He's been hiting for a while that he wants me to start a podcast/ stream duo games with him. 

Fast forward and the main bud comes back home to my state to have a snowboard trip with one of my few close friends and his buds. Planned all over xbox party chat primarily. It was a blast! W just happen to be on the same level. He told me im his oldest and best friend he's had and it's wild were back in contact after 5 years of light chatter. Now we talk everyday, give either advice, uplift each other in our goals/say wild shit in the group chat, and send memes to one another.

He moved to Hawaii recently tho but says to always hit him up when he visits and expects me to visit sometime. Now I'm planing on visiting him in Hawaii next year where he will host me for a week.

BaubleThief,"Worked my ass off, barriers, made it into my masters","Found out today I was accepted into my Masters for next year. I am blown away. I have worked so freaking hard, and have been sick with stress. I started my grad dip in psych 3 yrs ago,  got married, fell pregnant, had a 27 wk preemie, spent 3 months in hospital,  bubba came home on oxygen. She came off in time to attend my graduation. I had a surprise pregnancy (don't judge, precautions were certainly taken) and bubba 2 rocked up this yr, another preemie, putting my studies on hold. The sponsorship/scholarship program I worked so hard to get changed, meaning I had to take time off to have bubba and then reapply, all whilst the study requirements increased. All good, I'm stubborn if not  intelligent. New  prerequisites for future job meant even more study. I can do this I guess. I apply for my Masters, send out my references, sit the interview and I bloody got it. I just want to toot my own horn for the first time ever. I'm almost 35 and have never had a full time wage.

veggiebuttt,"At 21, I finally got a license and a car!","When I was in high school I never learned to drive. My parents aren’t together and I think that they were putting the responsibility of teaching me on each other (think “if her dad isn’t contributing the. I’m not doing it” mentality). So when I left home to go to college and started living on my own, I had to rely on friends, walking and the extremely limited public transportation. Eventually I got a bike and used for literally everything for 3 years. Disclaimer: biking in the rain and attempting to go grocery shopping on a bike is not fun lmao.

I moved in with my grandparents due to COVID and I was able to learn how to drive, save up, and get my ideal first car! Honestly, having a car feels so surreal. I don’t have to feel like a burden to people when I need to get somewhere. I don’t have to commute 30 minuted on a bike to get to my job that’s literally minutes away. Yesterday I went grocery shopping and just being able to fit everything in my car as opposed to balancing 4+ bags in my bike basket was enough to make me super happy. 

I’m basically at a point where I want to find any excuse to run errands just because I can. I’ve been wanting to get Coffee Bean for like 3 months but didn’t want to ask my grandparents to take me, so as a reward for myself, I’m getting Coffee Bean this morning.

Ive gone back a few times. I was waiting in line hoping to see her, she delivers the car infront of mines food. I had not seen her so I thought I was SOL again. She turns around and I call out her name.

She comes back to my car and she remembered who I was.

I straight up asked her ""This is probably super unprofessional but, youre cute as hell, ***To which she thanked me for the compliment***  ""and Id love to get to know you more or take you on a date.""

She asked me if i wanted her number to which I said hell yeah. I texted her as soon as I got home and am waiting for her reply. She did say she was tired and has to work tomorrow.

I even found a pair that was looser than the others lol... 

This is so important to me, because at some point when I weighted more than (83 kg), all I could fit were elastic pants, the ones that stretch out, and I had only one pair, so imagine the struggle... 

I'm still overweight (73 kg) in relation to my height (154 cm). But I won't stop here, since I reached this motivating milestone, I'm ready more than ever to continue my journey !

phantasmagoria1996,I'm finally soooo happy to clear off my student loan! Such a huge relief!,"Aaaahhhh! Where do I even start? Disclaimer : it's a long post!!

I'm from a remote town in India with a dream to pursue my Masters is the US. It wasn't an easy path as my parents wanted me to stay back and take a job that I'd gotten and support the family. Instead I fought with them and took a student loan and assured them that they don't have to spend a single dime towards my education and finally they agreed. (They weren't hesitant about me getting higher education, we are from a caste that is known to do business and they expected me to take over my dad's business which I never saw myself doing for the rest of my life.)
Life wasn't easy here at all. Though I had an undergrad degree in electronics and communication, my life long desire to become a doctor (could never become a reality because I've been diagnosed with blood injury phobia) made me pursue a degree in bioengineering (I envisioned building a medical device that could save people's lives). It wasn't easy as I had no proper background in biology except for what I learnt in high school. But I never gave up, I kept myself going and soon realized that it's very hard to get a job in bioengineering without a PhD or being a non-US citizen. I switched to doing a minor in a more computational field and ended up taking Machine learning and tried to work as a research assistant in labs at the intersection of ML and healthcare. All my batchmates were graduating and I was still struggling to find an internship. Finally I found one and I had to extend my school by a quarter to do the internship. I got very good exposure and hands on experience during my internship and then back to square one - searching for a FT job. My resume would not even get past the resume screening software that's used by companies because I was applying to a ML job with a Bioengineering major when people in CS couldn't crack it. Finally, got a job as a data scientist in a financial organization. They put me through 11 rounds of rigorous interview hoping I would fail but I nailed all of them and my manager thinks I'm an asset to the team. It took me 9 months to clear off my student loan and I couldn't be proud of myself!!!

All I want to say is NEVER SAY NEVER!! Keep hustling and your hard work is paid off in one form or the other. :)

TL;DR - Fought with my parents to come pursue masters in bioengineering, realized the job market is really dry, did a minor in machine learning, beat the odds of getting a job with a Bioengineering major and clearing off the student loans within 9 months.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/k8y7ez/im_finally_soooo_happy_to_clear_off_my_student/,2020-12-08 05:20:08,1,6,0

JasoNMas73R,I gave my address to a stranger and to my surprise he held on to his promise!,"I know this sounds weird and stupid, but this is just too humble. I need to share this with the world! I still can't believe it...

So, a few weeks ago in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/juyq6o/homemade_garlic_cayenne_cheezits/gcgrgbh/) thread about home made Cheez-Its I openly wondered what Cheez-Its would taste like since they don't sell them in my country (The Netherlands) and there was this guy that asked me to DM me because he was prepared to send them to me.

So I, the curious kid, went ahead and messaged him, not entirely sure if I should take this serious or if I even should trust this total stranger. But my gut feeling said to me I should still give out my address and see what happens (oh boy my mom would sure like this lol). He even asked if I wanted more stuff to get shipped besides the Cheez-Its and I told him to send over some Twinkies, Mac 'n Cheese, Ritz, some Chex and a few Butterfingers. While he did say I could add more stuff to the package, I didn't knew anything else so I told him the rest can be a surprise because I find those to be exiting.

Fast forward to a few days ago and I get buzzed by the mailman. It's a package. From the US. I could not believe what was happening. Did this really happen? I know us Redditors can be kind and humble but this is literally next level. I take the package upstairs and I could, yet again, not believe what I saw in front of me.

The thought of growing older and losing this curiosity seems to bother me, since without it, I think life would feel dull and meaningless. We wouldn't have much of a desire to understand the workings of ourselves and environment.

throwitawayst,"Today, for the first time, I realized I have hopes and dreams.","If you would have asked me yesterday, “what do you hope for your future?” or “what do you dream of doing with your life?” I wouldn’t have had an answer. I would’ve felt uncomfortable because I never have had an answer to those questions. 

Then today, I woke up, and for whatever reason. I started typing In my notes. Typing about something I’ve been feeling for a while. Simply in order to understand the feeling. So I typed, then read and revised, then typed, then read and revised and so on, for nearly 6 hours, until i felt like I got everything out and it was written down how I wanted it to be. Written so that if someone who wasn’t me read it, even they would understand it.

When I was done, honestly, I felt sick to my stomach. I typed out some things I’ve never said. Then I read it once more, and realized I typed out the answers to those two questions. There they were, right in front of my face. Suddenly, I didn’t feel sick anymore. Instead I felt happy. So absolutely, incredibly, very very happy. 

My life has never had any direction, or any kind of purpose at all. And suddenly, I feel like it has both. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/k7mxhw/today_for_the_first_time_i_realized_i_have_hopes/,2020-12-06 04:28:47,1,2,0

Last night I was laying on the couch with my neck in an uncomfortable position just so I could be cuddled up with him. We went for a jog earlier in the day,  and were pleasantly tired and full from the very healthy dinner he'd cooked with the food I'd brought over. I was just feeling great and I could tell he was too. We'd just finished the last chapter of Resident Evil 6 and were watching garbage movies and laughing at them together.
  
  
That was when I said ""I think this is what people talk about when they say that someone is their other half. I think this is what it feels like. We like all the same stuff, we literally have the same really random not-obvious thoughts all the time,  I think you're my other half. ""
  
  
And this smooth mofo turns to me and says ""I feel the same way, except for one thing.""
  
  
When I pressed he responded ""I ***know*** you're my other half.""

OGhound,I'm a person worthy of love and deserve a place in this world,"2020 has been a great year for me

COVID19 has sucked obviously, but it has given me the chance to redefine who I am. I got out of a dead end relationship early on this year, had the opportunity to move out of a city I hated, and pushed me to seek mental help via counseling. Ive found the ability to believe in myslef and discover a passion for home brewing. 

After several moves, I now live in a place where I feel comfortable around my roommates and have a re-invigorated sense of self. For the first time in 5+ years, I now believe in who I am as a person and can see my future goals as tangible. 

Tonight I was able to spend some time with a new girl who enjoys so many things that I like myself. We have the same taste in music, fun, and so many other hobbies. 

Im excited to see where 2021 takes me and I cant wait to experience the year as a brand new person, sompletely different from who I was a year ago.

And my boyfriend just bought an artificial one for his new apartment this year.

However.... I recently moved into the downstairs apartment in my house and since it's my own little space, I bought a REAL tree! Its just a tiny little guy that I spotted in the tree lot when I was driving back from work. He's just under 3 feet and has a circular base made of birch. Not sure how to take care of him but I got a shallow serving bowl thing and filled it with water for him to sit in.

I am just so stoked to have a real tree this year! I took lights that I had in my room and dressed the lil guy up real nice and then I'm gonna steal some ornaments from my parents and spruce him up (pun intended).

throwaway-gsyvyhth,Escaped fiendzone - going on a date with my friend!," Yesterday we were supposed to spend some time in a group of 7 friends. Unfortunately 5 people backed off due to some personal things. So at the end it was only me and my friend. I believe it is worth mentioning that I have massive crush on him for well over a year, but instead I went straight to his friendzone. Anyway we decided that we still could hang out and have a good time. (it is nothing new as two of us actually hangs out quite regulary)

After dinner, some drinks and talks we started to brag about dating. As we both were single for some time + tipsy and childish at the moment the best course of action was to play this stupid games with caps and gates where loser would call his or her crush and ask out on a date. It was no surprise that I lost. I was surprised that I actually had the guts to call his number, thus admitting my feelings - something I could not force myself to do for a long time. What happened next was just.. 'Ha, you called me out of habit. Wait, you are serious?' and a kiss, long one - I was not expecting that. So yeah - long story short - we are going on a date on Friday. We wanted yesterday's meeting to end as it started - with us just as a friends, but we did maked out again. Right now I am still so excited I could not focus on anything.

i_am_not_called_hank,Today I actually felt cared about for the first time in 3 years,"(sorry for bad formatting I'm on mobile)

Now this isn't one those post saying 'i have a girlfriend now pogchamp'. 

This is a short anecdote about why you should always be kind to people not for clout or whatever but just because you can.


So I get bullied alot in school due to how I acted in year 7-8 (I'm in year 9 currently) and because of those bullies I now no longer am in a classroom and instead sit on a table near said classroom

Now because of the bullying and the fact that a few of my friends can be a******* at times, I became very depressed (I don't think it was just that tho as it runs in my familly)

I've been outside the classroom for about 3 weeks with no signs of being put in a new classroom and that is annoying because I hate just sitting there doing nothing because it's boring as f*ck

Anyway back to the point, nearing the end of the day my friend (we'll call her Sarah for the sake of anonymity) walks past and asks why I'm out of class.  

Sarah: why are you out here?

Me: the class is full of assholes so I walked out

Sarah: oh ok

*she walks off* 

A few minutes (maybe like 10) later she walks past again because she's going back to class and we once again conversate because I look quite sad (because I'm p*ssed off about the bullying and all the stress that comes with life)

Sarah: so what kind of bullying do you mean?

Me: just name calling and hitting and shit

Sarah: are you ok? 

Me: yeah I'm fine (I say this to avoid awkwardness)

Sarah: are you sure? You look pretty sad.

Me: yeah, i'm just stressed that's all

Sarah: ok then... If you wanna talk about it then just message me.

Me: maybe... (I probably seemed like an asshole for saying this)

And honestly this is the first time I've felt like someone cared about me in 3 years

This may not seem like much but it made my day and took me out of depressing thoughts for a few hours afterward.

My point is: you should talk to people who you think may be going through a tough time and make sure they're okay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/k4tk18/today_i_actually_felt_cared_about_for_the_first/,2020-12-01 20:38:36,1,5,0

anon456e,"Good things are finally beginning to happen to me after 2 years of unhappy, depressing, torture, and I’m cute apparently.","
Honestly I didn’t think I would make it through my mother’s death. I was fearful of being homeless once I was out of school. I was getting denied from every job I applied to. I only managed to get to law school from poverty because she helped. I was emotionally K.O.ed from my brother abusing my mother and me, stealing my stuff and fleeing before she died. Not like he was helping anyway...yeah yeah I guess I’ll juggle classes and carrying her to her end of life alone. Thanks bro. 

Without her, I’d be homeless post grad (next year).

I skipped classes for weeks, focused only on applying, and eventually landed my dream job. Instead of being on food stamps and homeless, I’ll be litigating making 6 figures. But even after that point I was so behind for the time I took off I felt defeated. I drilled class after class trying to catch up. It really depressed my mental state.

I was really out of it today. Went for a walk. I sit down, this person comes up to me, asks me where the nearest dunks is. I pull it up on my phone. They start walking away, and when they are about 6 feet away they call back and inform me that I’m cute.

That was....the best actual random even I’ve had happen to me in about 13 months. 

Idk maybe I have value beyond this job, and despite these difficult last two year...thing might just now be rounding their way back up :).

Good things are starting to happen again.

minorfall27,"Two years after separation, I have found resilience, and yes, happiness.","Two years ago, my world shattered.  

Our nuclear family, depicted as cheery penguins on the Christmas tree, fell apart.  I’ll spare you the details on exactly what happened, because that’s not the point of my writing this.  Like I said, it was two years ago.

Separation is something that's not easily talked about.  Not on a public scale, at least.  It’s swept under the social media rug, and left on that cutting room floor.  It’s not pretty, it’s not something you can put a filter on to make it better.  You just have to walk through it; and that takes time.  Two years’ worth of time, for me.

There’s firsts that you have to do all over again.  There’s relationships you have to do all over again.  The first series of holidays.  The first time the kids spend the night away from you.  The first school forms you fill out with separate addresses.  All of these moments become building blocks, for the new life you are cobbling.  All of those rebuilt relationships, with friends and family, they are the mortar.

I call all these firsts ‘divorce band-aids’ that you have to rip off, and here’s another one:  The first family pictures.  

Our last family pictures were taken three years ago, and they were beautiful.  They were about the bonds we shared as a family, and I can hold no regrets for that.  

When you look at this picture, I hope you don’t see what’s missing, because nothing is.  Their dad is still very much present, albeit in a different set of family pictures, I suppose.

Instead, look at what is there.  Notice what my incredibly talented friend managed to capture.  My four-year-old’s smirk is telltale of her entire personality.  Look at the way my 6-year-old has to bend down to her mom, because she’s gotten too tall for her own good.  The outfits and accessories that I spent way too much time and energy picking out, all in a single shot.  The beautiful greenery surrounding us.

This picture is still about the bonds we share, but for me, it’s about something else.  It’s about resilience.  

It’s about the journey we have taken to get to this place, and the joy therein.

Life is a series of Chapter Ones, both sad and happy.  When you graduate college, and land that job.  When you lose someone.  When you move to a new city.  When you start a family.  When you battle illness.  Those days and moments that define you.

If my Chapter One was two years ago, this picture is about a woman supported and strong enough to get to the next chapter, and all the chapters thereafter.

chkhvz,"When I was in high school, my parents fell on hard times. I was an athlete and wanted to show off my accomplishments with a letterman jacket, but we were living paycheck-to-paycheck and there was no way they could afford it.","Twelve years later, they offered to gift me that jacket for Christmas. It's been so long-- but you bet I dug up all my patches and drove to our local athletics supply store this morning to order the jacket I always wanted! A part of me feels dumb for being so excited about this. I'm almost 30 and wouldn't say I'm stuck in the past at all, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still proud of my accomplishments from those days. And it really warmed my heart to hear my parents share in my excitement. I think it meant a lot to them then, and still means a lot to them now, feeling that they raised ambitious, hard-working children; these ""championship"" and ""scholar athlete"" patches I had stuffed in a shoebox are like a symbolic testament to that.

I didn't know who I could share this with because of the stigma surrounding grown-ass people reminiscing about the ""good ol' days"" and sporting varsity jackets, so I came here. I'm just having a beautiful day and wanted to share this with someone. I think at the core, it's not about the jacket itself but about knowing that my parents are proud of me and recognize how important sports were for me growing up. What's more, sports provided an escape when my parents went through a years-long rough patch. It wasn't easy to remain focused after my dad had a few stress-induced health scares on top of the financial problems, so not only was getting my varsity letter and accompanying patches an accomplishment just because it was a way to say, ""Yeah, I'm good at sports,"" but it was also a healthy outlet for an angsty teenager who could have spent that energy on destructive activities. I think in the end what my letterman jacket represents is beyond just the ""glory days"" of high school... It's a testament to my ability to pull my moody teenage self through school and extracurriculars at a time when we were close to losing our stability, our home, and our family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/k2anq2/when_i_was_in_high_school_my_parents_fell_on_hard/,2020-11-27 22:01:36,1,4,0

redrocketinn,I'm pretty sure I just solved a mystery that has been bothering me since I could remember,"So apparently when I was younger around *pre* pre-school and throughout up until grade school maybe, I had a ""girlfriend."" There's a few pictures of us together. But my parents said we always hung around each other. 

From time to time whilst looking through my old photographs I would see those pictures and wonder, ""Who the heck is this girl? Where is she now? What even is her name?""

My parents didn't know as it was a long time ago. 

Well, yesterday I scanned all of my pictures into my computer to have them safe. That's when I noticed in one of the pictures there were name placards on the table. I finally had a name. And for some reason, it hit me. A name of someone I had spent my entire schooling with came to me.

I immediately go to Messenger to ask her if she was in the same pre-school as me. That's when I looked at her profile picture and compared that with the childhood pictures. They look extremely similar, like strikingly.

The only problem is we were never really that close growing up, different cliques and such. 

But it's just crazy to me that this entire time of wondering who and where she was, she was right there with me the whole time. That is of course if it's actually her.

_mari_fox_,"After a disastrous relationship that made me lose hope in love, I finally found love again","It makes exactly 4 weeks we met each other.

One night, I (19 F) was at a friend's place, together with other close friends of mine. We were having fun, until my friend Jo (let's call him that) starts receiving messages from a colleague of ours. He seemed quite lost and we didn't know what to do. He said he needed to leave in 10 minutes. 'Well, okay', we though.

We resumed whatever we were doing until he had to leave. Then he turns to me and says 'Oh, he (the guy messaging him) wants you to come too'. I was surprised, to say the least, but I accepted. We said our goodbyes and headed out.

Outside, 4 people were waiting for us. They were super nice guys and explained what was going on (a story for another time). Among them was a guy we will call G. I took the time to know everyone (since we were from the same course and all that), but I ended up bonding specially well with G.

He's 2 years older than me (21 M) and a very interesting person. It was extremely easy to talk to him, which is nice to me since I find it very hard to talk to people I don't know very well (I've been working on it and I'm way better at it now :) ). We bonded over memes, the ultimate bonding material, and he told me some of his traveling adventures. We shares some more stories and all felt... so nice! It was amazing to be with him, like it was meant to be.

Later that night, the group slowly disbanded and he walked me home since it was rather late. We kept on talking all night, it was just that natural. At some point there might have been some crying from my part and a very nice hug coming from his, but our convo was generaly nice and I learnt some very cool stuff from him.

The clock hits 4 a.m. and we had to say our goodbyes.

The following day we talked non stop. I felt like a little girl everytime I read his messages. It was such a nice feeling. We talked about how much we enjoyed our late night talk and how much we wanted to talk like that again.

Somehow, I invited him to my house for dinner. We enjoyed each other's company for a while and it was so much fun! We were so very at ease, it was amazing.

He slept over that night. We cuddled like it was natural to us. And, on GOD, there were so many moments we could have kissed. It was the best feeling in the world, to feel so comfortable with someone.

We woke up the next morning and I was the only one that had classes, so we cuddled a little bit more. Needless to say I skipped the only class I had.

Cuddling eventually evolved to talking about our thoughts. ""Have you thought about kissing me?"", he asked. Thinking back, I would be lying if I said no. But it's not like I want to kiss everyone I cuddle with.

I quickly realised in what situation I had got myself into. I felt so embarased I almost couldn't answer. To think I had fallen for him, specially that fast! "" Well, yes. What about you?"" ""I thought about it too. But do you want to kiss?"" I just nodded. It was all I could do. My heart was racing at this point. But he was super nice to me the whole time.

Days went by and spend more and more time together. I feel like I fall for him more and more every single day. We started by taking things slow, as it should be. Today, we plan on buying promise rings this Wednesday.

And that's is that :) He makes me the happiest girl in the world and I make him the happiest boy. Sometimes I think this is too good to be true, like a dream, but when I wake up next to him I want nothing else ♥",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/k08ttg/after_a_disastrous_relationship_that_made_me_lose/,2020-11-24 16:58:41,1,6,0

borbafett1,"Hey Redditors! The first film I directed premieres this Thanksgiving on Amazon, iTunes, Google Movies, select theaters and more!","Hey Redditors! My film premieres on Thanksgiving on Amazon and in select theaters! Hello neighbors! My name is Ricky Borba, and I’m a film director. This Thanksgiving my second film, Hope for the Holidays, will debut on Amazon, iTunes, Google movies, YouTube movies, and iScreening Room. Earlier this year, my first film, My Brothers’ Crossing, was in theaters nationwide right before theaters were shut down. 

Here is a link to the trailer: 
https://youtu.be/1RrF4R7uJoE

Hope For the Holidays is a film I began working on in 2017. It stars Oscar Nominated and Golden Globe winning actors and actresses. The basic story is that a mother, played by Sally Kirkland, finds out she has cancer. Her son, played by George Stults, goes into panic mode and decides to rob a bank to pay for her medical bills. He gets caught, goes to prison, and the rest of the film is a race against time for him to see his mother one last time before she passes away, IF he can get out of prison.

This is where things get really personal and beautiful for me. Yes, beautiful. Just two months later, that July, my own mother called to tell me she had Stage IV cancer, and she died just 7 weeks after finding out. My mother and I were as close as a son and mother could be, so this was incredibly difficult.

However.

With the permission of the original writer of the script and the producer, I was able to almost completely rewrite the character played by Sally Kirkland, to say in the film, the same exact things my mom told me on her seven-week battle with cancer. Without exception, almost every scene in the film, Sally's character Georgia is saying verbatim, what my mom said in real life. 

It was a truly cathartic and beautiful way for me to honor my mother. To direct a film, my first film at the time, about the story of a mother and son, a mother who has cancer and wants to see her son one more time. I feel truly blessed and thankful that I was able to honor my mother this way, and that is one of the many reasons I can't wait for you to see this film. It's my hope that it encourages and inspires you, and at the same time is a film that you agree is made with excellence.

So please give it a watch this holiday season and let me know what you think. I'd love to hear your thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jz7dwc/hey_redditors_the_first_film_i_directed_premieres/,2020-11-23 00:46:58,1,5,0

misuinu,I'm so happy this year I can finally give gifts to those I love ♡,"A couple years ago I was living off $20 a week after paying rent with my friend, I was jobless (visa issue), the money I received was from my mum back in the UK. 

After returning home to the UK I started going to school and working part time for minimum wage. I started taking the correct steps to get my visa that would allow me to work, and saved up all the money I got to do so..

So many people helped me during the times I was jobless or saving up to create a life I wanted.. my best friend, my mum, I'm forever grateful. 

Now I'm able to work an above minimum wage job back in Canada, doing well this time! I'm so, so beyond happy that I'm able to spoil everyone I love (I never could before!!!) I never came from money, my mum did her best and I'm forever grateful for this, I know what it's like to struggle week to week and giving back is making me tear up, as I'm decorating gift boxes and cards I'm thankful to all of those who were in my life throughout all of my struggles and making them feel happy with a surprise is making me ecstatic.

I've never been able to comfortably afford to buy ANYONE gifts before, I cant put into words just how happy it makes me to be able to give gifts I just cant get over it.. I cant believe I'm able to do this!

CrepeSuzette85,I cleared my first week without antidepressants,"Small milestone but after many years of depression I tried several antidepressants. The first one failed but the second one worked wonders for me. I ran out of it about a week ago, maybe longer, and upon talking to my doctor and taking an assessment online I may no longer need them as of today. I'm still shy and a little unsure about things when it comes to myself, but I'm not in that pit of despair anymore. I went a full week without the pill needing to give me a burst of energy just to get through the day. I worked, I talked to friends, I stayed on task, (I did get very irritable at some points, but I'm working through that too), and I still have an interest in music and my hobbies. I'm not turning to food for comfort either so maybe I can keep this weight off too. I'm just really happy about all of this and I wasn't sure where to post it. I was in such a deep dark place before and it's refreshing to wake up and be able to manually pick out reasons to be happy instead of taking a pill to run on autopilot.

Majeure21,I am ecstatic that the world is going to back to normal.,"This was my first time paying such close attention to vaccine news. I have always taken vaccines that were required and recommended, but I have never followed the development/testing/approval so closely.

I had no idea how vaccine development works, but I am thrilled to see that scientists are finally closing in. God bless the good people of Moderna and Pfizer, and everyone else who tried to help.

The vaccines are not a big on/off switch for the world. The world will turn back on gradually, and some things might never be the same.

Everyone by now has heard the skepticism of whether going back “normal” is possible. I don’t think we’ll ever go back to how things were in January 2020, but we can get back what’s important.

I think we learned for example that some things can happen virtually, like low-priority meetings, so those kinds of things might stay virtual even when it’s safe to go back to in-person.

But there’s so much stuff that HAS to be in-person. Hugs are something I have never missed this much. I was never much for touching, but when you can’t have any physical contact outside your family for 7 months, you really start longing for a hug, even a ballroom dance.

I might never turn down a coffee date again. Not that very many people ever asked me out on them (haha), but having been through such a long period of time when I wasn’t allowed to go out for coffee with anyone, I might just have an open invite for anyone who wants coffee with me. As long as we can drink it together, I’ll buy you the coffee.

The world is such a big place with so many amazing things you can do and so many amazing people you can meet. You can hang out in a book club, you can volunteer in a prison, you can ask your crush out on a date, you can sit at a local coffee shop and write a story with your friends, you can go to an estate sale. When you’ve been denied the opportunity to do all these things, you’ll never take another day for granted again.

Maybe in two months, maybe in six months, maybe in eight months... I have no idea when the world will re-open. But for the first time, we can look forward with great hope that there’s an end in sight.

V921_C12,Finally in a good relationship after a bad one!,"A while back, I was in a relationship with a guy, G. He was really toxic for me, and I chose to deny it every time someone told me so. He had touched me when I said no, he had cheated on me, and manipulated me many times. It was constant arguments, constant sadness, and constant crying. I was hardly ever happy in that relationship besides probably the first month or two. Overall we had dated for only about 13 months. Not too long, but enough to have me afraid of what might come next. 

A few months later, I had met this boy, Y. He was a friend of my guy friend. Y and I started talking quite a bit. I told him I had interest in him, and he told me he felt the same. We started dating and he brought me such happiness. He constantly reassured me if I felt off about something. He would listen to me when I cry and comfort me. If I didn’t want to do something specific, he wouldn’t force me. He respected me and never crossed a boundary. If so, never physically and he was always willing to listen to my thoughts. 

Just a few days ago, Y and I had music on. It was nighttime and we were dancing and singing together. We were listening to Million Dollar Bill by Dawes. He had tried to pull a funny dance stunt and instead fell down bringing me with. I landed on top of him. Nothing more than that. We made eye contact and just bursted out laughing. It was fun.

Inazumaryoku,My wife finally got hired after being jobless for 3 years... and she became my coworker!,"Due to personal and health reasons, she had to stop working for a few months back in 2017. 

One year, two years, three years have passed and she wasn't able to get back to a proper job. She mostly worked freelance online during that time, and even had to work part time at a fastfood joint for us to afford bills. I told her no pressure, these things takes time.

Then one day, I got an email from my boss asking if I know someone who can fill a sudden vacant position. My wife fit the requirements and so I immediately told her about it. She said she wanted to try...

A couple weeks later of crossing our fingers, she finally got the job and now we're working together!

Granted, her workplace is at a different building, so we don't literally work together. But it's so awesome to sit next to her during our meetings, finding solutions to the same work problems, and it's fun to guide her how things work around here!

Our next happy problem is learning how to handle the influx of having our household income suddenly getting doubled. We were terrible in handling it and bought ourselves so many expensive gadgets with her first official salary.

WaffleStomperGirl,My bank was incredibly nice and accomodating after I had $700 stolen from my account. My faith in humanity was set right because of how well they treated me.,"Well, the title says it all, really. 

I was going to buy my medicine and pay my bills, for which I had plenty of money aside, to be hit hard with the feeling of violation when my bank showed $700 less than should be in there. 
I was panicked. I felt sick, and dizzy. And that’s from the emotional side of it - the physical side would set it very quickly if I couldn’t get my medications. 

So in a panic I went to my bank. 
The first thing that immediately made me feel good was that as soon as they saw how distressed I was they asked me if I wanted to sit and if I’d like a cup of water. I did. Then after hearing what I had to say they took me to a private room. The lady - Wendy - was the most amazing individual. She pulled up my bank statements and immediately recognised the false transactions. She smiled, pouring me another cup of cold water (it’s Australia, so it’s hot) and reassured me she could see clear as day that those were not transactions done by me and she would make sure I got my money back. 

This was fantastic, but there will still the issue of my medication and bills. 
To that, Wendy said she would happily credit my account with the amount needed and would just deduct it from the amount returned to my account. 

Only five days later and I got a call from Wendy saying the police had apprehended the lady responsible and my money should be in my account that afternoon. 

The speed, care, and thoughtfulness of the entire process has made me feel so good. So happy. I will be with this bank for the foreseeable future and will be recommending it to all locals. 

It’s a great feeling to be able to trust a bank to be looking out for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jvn9sk/my_bank_was_incredibly_nice_and_accomodating/,2020-11-17 05:19:08,10,5,0

charles_reads_books,My wife’s pregnant ass keeps waking me up,"So it’s about 5:30 AM over here in Atlanta, I’m on my front porch smoking my morning cigarette (yeah yeah yeah), I’ve been getting up early a lot lately, but I’m not complaining. I’m a paraplegic, I got shot about 20 years ago when I was 18 (loads of fun let me tell you), my wife and I met about 5 years ago any got married about 2 years ago, we got together older in life so there was no beating around the bush, we knew what we wanted; family, dog, white fence, etc. After settling down and working through some normal stuff we started the whole IVF process about a year ago, we had no idea what to expect but had an encouraging initial consultation. Fast forward a year to now. The pandemic certainly screwed up plans, procedures got delayed, time sensitive processes got delayed causing huge expenditures (this is America, we don’t care about stuff like this here apparently, so insurance of course doesn’t cover it and we’re about $40k into it already, #becauseAmerica). We were eventually able to get 1, a single embryo, that was viable, one chance to get it right, or else we’d have to do almost everything all over again. Tensions were high. Tears abound. We had our transfer, on our birthday interestingly (we share a birthday, although she’s one year older than I am), it went well and was quick, it was surreal. We then sit with baited breath for a few weeks and then order like 50 pregnancy tests, she took one and SHE’S FUCKING PREGNANT YALL!  And instantly, within a femtosecond, everything changed. I get it now. Life makes so much more sense now. I’ve had to budget Gatoraid into my monthly expenses because I’m crying so much. This is so crazy. I’ve never been more attracted to my wife more than I am now, things that used to seem so mundane to me now mean the world, my little pod has become my entire universe. I just can’t stop thinking about it, it wakes me up at night, the other day she texted me when I was presenting in a virtual meeting and I just lost it. We have a long road ahead of us, and lots of opportunity for failure, but this is so encouraging, and one of the only bright spots in the year. I wish all others that are on this journey much love and respect, I hope with all my being that it works out for you too, because we all deserve this feeling.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jtf2mg/my_wifes_pregnant_ass_keeps_waking_me_up/,2020-11-13 10:56:38,1,42,0

I’d been out of work for over a month after losing my job to the pandemic, and was only a few weeks out from being in serious trouble.Stopped to change out of my heels, and got a phone call. 

It was a recruiter telling me I’d been successful for a job I’d interviewed for, that I thought I didn’t have a chance in hell of getting. It’s my dream job, started the following week, and was a 40% pay increase to the job I’d lost from COVID.

nrfft21,Feel like 80% of my life problems would be solved by learning to be happy for others,"Hi!

This is my first post on Reddit, not sure if I'm posting in the correct community even. I'm just looking for some guidance on how to approach this toxic mindset that is doing me no good.

Basically, I've become increasingly envious/jealous of certain people, and the blessings they've been given. I recognise that everyone has their hardships and majority of the time I only hold their life in high-regard because I'm seeing the highlights of their life. Which is fine; I accept that with social media very few people are going to be their authentic selves online. But I feel a lot of my problems are rooted in me wanting others not to have something good - if I see someone with a happy relationship, rather than just wanting it for myself as well, I **also** don't want them to have it. If I see someone with a great job offer, I don't want them to have it. If I see someone with a supportive family relationship, I'd rather they don't have it. Sometimes its things that I have myself, but I don't want others to have.

I get triggered everytime I see someone have something that I feel is a blessing, because it brings about deep feelings of envy to the point where I want that thing to be taken away from them.

A key example being a girl on Instagram who posted about her married life being 'amazing' so far. She probably meant well, and she was actually asked about it from her followers so wasn't just an off-the-cuff braggy post. And she seems like a genuinely nice person; always happy to help others and seems sweet in her replies. But as soon as she posted that, I feel so envious of her. I even Googled 'when does the Honeymoon Period of a relationship end?', which came up with a 12-18 month average post-marriage estimate. Then looked at when she got married, timed how long she had left until her Honeymoon Period would start to fizzle out, and felt better about myself that she was past the 12-month mark. Insane, I know. And it feels me with deep sadness typing that out, because that is just one example of many. I probably do something like this every 1 to 2 days. Again, insane.

This is why I came to confine in the lovely community of Reddit. What do I even do with myself? I genuinely want to be happy for others. I know I have a lot to be happy about in my life, and even where I have problems (like every other human), I want to work on them rather than wanting others to have the same/similar issues in their life. But I want to start with being able to look at someone's life, and be truly happy for them, and to want whatever blessing they have to increase. How do I go about doing so?",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jr88o4/feel_like_80_of_my_life_problems_would_be_solved/,2020-11-09 22:41:19,1,3,0

So, today I got to see my partner for the first time in a few weeks (because of classes and other time consuming stuff, and we don't live together).

We express ourselves pretty well though, but that's irrelevant. Back to the story lol. Throughout this pandemic, we have always been particularly careful about contact: always masked, and only sometimes hugging. Our parents are potentially at risk, and I think it's more loving to protect each other's family than physical touch. But today we met up to go hiking on a trail (masked and distanced from others), and there was one part where the trail was particularly steep, with roots and greenery everywhere. We reached out and took each other's hands to steady each other, and I know that it's cliché but I was filled with euphoria, and I'm still riding on it.  I also lathered my arm in Germ-X once I got back to my car to stay safe. It had been so long, and I could go on and on about how he means the world to me, though this post is probably long enough.

Head-Maize,"My last job offer, six years ago, was for 4800€ a year. Today I applied for a position and demanded a 75'000€ wage. It took massive sacrifice, and living without heating or portable water, but I did it!","About 6-7 years ago, unemployment, specially for youth, skyrocketed past 50%. I have no family since I turned 18, and I made three suicide attempts between the age of 20 and 24. At the 25 I managed to get into one of Europe's best public universities, graduate from a bachelor, and just graduated from my master's. 

Before getting into uni, I had applied to hundreds of places, and the last positive offer I had was for 400€/month (less than minimum wage) for about 50h of work/week and a 1h30 commute. When I passed the uni entrance exam, I moved into what was an abandoned house for minimal rent. I lived without heating, with temperature dropping near 0C, as me and my dog huddled for warmth. I commuted on foot mostly, with a portion on trains - I also had to carry 12 litters of water and all other groceries uphill for 40min. But I did it, I graduated cum laude from my alma matter, and applied for work a a dozen place. Today I wouldn't think of accepting less than 55'000€ a year, and am actually demanding 75'000€ for the tricky position. Before it would have taken me nearly fifteen years to earn that!

Chayley,My best friend's gf has always been super supportive of our friendship and it makes so happy that she is such a wonderful person,"For context (if it wasn't obvious) I am a female. My one of my absolute best friends is male. He and I have been close ever since high school. He's been with his gf since about junior year. Now I don't know her as well, she and I are friends and we talk here and there, but we didn't have classes together so I only ever saw her when I saw them together. 

He and I talk everyday, about anything and everything. When I'm down he always does his best to boost my confidence. He is an amazing friend, and I'm lucky to have him. They have a baby together and he named me as their sons godmother. They came and visited me several times when I was away at college.

It makes me really happy that never once has she shown me even an ounce of jealousy regarding my friendship with him. In fact just today she and I were talking and I was telling her I was planning on going back with my husband for a visit, and she was so excited and told me how we should keep it as a surprise for Tom (fake name for my bestie) and how much he would love it if we could surprise him on his birthday.

It just really warms my heart because I know so many females would have told him that he had to stop talking to me. In fact I lost another person I once considered a good friend for that very reason. His wife was jealous of me and made him cut off all contact, which hurt but I got over it eventually.

navyrook,"As a college student, I voted for the first time in the presidential election a few days ago in Georgia.","I have always been somewhat disillusioned about how much my vote matters, considering how there are 300 million people in this country. But, at the encouragement of a very close friend of mine who I look up to very much, I decided to register as a voter in Georgia around a month ago.

However, I figured that my voter ID wouldn't arrive in time for the election, and I had no other form of Georgia ID because I am not originally from Georgia- just here for university- so I decided to get a learner's permit as a foolproof way of ensuring that I would have a Georgia ID on me. I didn't want to use a provisional ballot as those can be messed with, especially considering levels of voter suppression for this election. 

As predicted, my voter ID indeed did not come in time for the election, so I used my brand new learner's permit instead on Election Day. I put my ballot in the ballot counting machine, and watched as the number of counted ballots rose: 96 to 97. Then I left, assuming that 'oh well, I've done my civic duty, I'm sure there will be larger than a 1-2% margin anyway'.

Except Georgia ended up being one of the most nail-biting battleground states; as I'm writing this, Trump and Biden are only around a thousand votes apart. And one of those thousand votes that made the difference is mine! This experience has really inspired me to be more involved civically: I have seen for myself that, yes, my vote really CAN matter!

hazemallagui,Youth and Adolescents: The 7 Commandments Before the Age of 30! - Report,"&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/i8hhh9hl7ox51.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c7848f835c9b00854ecff07f2d7615e6f23c8d0)

When you are in your 20s, you often feel self-confidence and a desire to live and start. As if you are a nymph who seeks to free herself from her gloomy cocoon (school and university education), jump into the sea of life and experiment alone.

&amp;#x200B;

The period of adolescence and youth in the twenties is the basis from which everything begins. It determines whether you will live a different life full of opportunities and challenges, or a boring traditional life like the one that lived and lived in millions of years like your age.

&amp;#x200B;

The years will make you stand in the middle of the 20s full of opportunities, and the fullness of the thirties full of prudence and caution before making decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are a young man in his twenties or a teenager who has just come out of early childhood and is early to enjoy the difference, I recommend seven quick commandments, which you must take seriously before he is 30 years old!

chrisnaish,Millions of people heard my song and I had no idea!," I 2009, I sent a song to a music licensing company. They accepted it and said they'd try to get it on TV shows.

The tricky thing is: you only find out your song was on TV like 6-12 months after it was on the air, 'cause all the money goes through a different company. So I waited. And waited.

After a year or so, I stopped checking for royalties.

6 years later around Christmas time, I wondered whatever happened... probably nothing… but I checked my royalties account anyways. There was $200 bucks in my account!! 

They had been trying to send me cheques - but they had the wrong address! 

My song had been heard all over the world and I had no idea!! On shows like Teen Mom, Mike's Ultimate Garage, and stations like CMT, HGTV, MTV, THE CW, and more!!! I was so happy - I felt so validated as a musician!

Quirky_Friendship_87,9 HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA YOU PROBABLY NEVER KNEW ABOUT," **Greater flexibility**

The yoga routine includes muscle-strengthening poses. After just eight weeks of regular yoga practice, some people have noticed a 35% increase in flexibility! No matter what level of yoga you are practicing, you are holding poses that you inhale and exhale over and over again, which can increase your flexibility.

**More happiness**

Several thinking activities can improve mental health, but yoga is useful. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin found that people who meditate have more activity in the brain’s left prefrontal cortex. Increased activity in the left prefrontal cortex was associated with a higher sense of well-being.

According to these findings, the most effective postures to improve mental health focus on relaxation. Try sitting on a lotus flower or practicing the King of the Dance pose as part of your yoga routine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jmd3ld/9_health_benefits_of_yoga_you_probably_never_knew/,2020-11-02 00:05:26,1,2,0
grusel_cookie,I need someone to celebrate the rebuilt relationship with my brother with me!,"Tl;DR, talked to my brother the first time in years and am now crying with happiness

I moved out 4 years ago and already didn't really have a connection with my brother at that time due to mental problems and my mindset of having to deal with my stuff on my own. I let many relationship fade away over the past few years. Last year in april I started to realize that there are problems in my life and over the following months I started to see that I don't have to face them alone. I am slowly learning how to share moments of weakness and suffering, but it is a long road. It's getting better.

My brother is younger than me but I always felt like he was doing better in life than me, especially socially. I wasn't sure if he wanted to reconnect with me even though we used to be very close as children. I forgot about our close past in the troubles of puberty, I guess. But I called him yesterday. He didn't have time then but wrote that he was happy to hear from me and today we talked for an hour and it felt like 5 minutes and so close like the last few years didn't ever happen. He is doing okay, he struggles financially, but manages it somehow, he told me about his projects (he is a musician) and how he broke up with his girlfriend recently. I was able to talk about myself in a normal way, I wasn't painting my life in bright colors like I do sometimes when I am scared to share weakness, but I also didn't make fun of my struggles in an unhealthy way, as I also tend to do. I also told him about the good parts of my life. At the end, he said that he really wants to see me again. I wasn't at my parents last christmas and when I visited them afterwards, he was already gone and with covid it was hard to see each other lately so we didn't meet for over a year now. But I think I will visit my parents this christmas to see my brother.

I can't express how much this means to me. I am so happy. I was scared we alienated each other because when we met since I moved out, we never really connected, but it turns out we both want this relationship back, so it is there, it's as easy as that. I am so grateful, I am crying in my bed with happy tears for the last 20 minutes. I have my brother back and he likes me, who would have thought this would make me so happy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jlo7dq/i_need_someone_to_celebrate_the_rebuilt/,2020-10-31 19:12:10,1,3,0
yaboideppresion,I’ve become much happier because of money,"To start its pretty late so i might make some mistakes!
Now a couple of months back my brother has just given me 3$ in low worth bills,there were 30 of them.I didn’t know what to do with them so i decided to collect them (current goal being 10$).

 And a friend of mine is someone i knew from middle school but wasnt too close to since we were in different grades.Last year we entered high school an instantly became very close since we shared a couple of interests.

So since i started collecting money i found out she was collecting coins,her goal being 1 kg.We have a deal where we  exchange the bills and coins to help each others goals.Its always fantastic seeing the dumb smiles on our faces when the other gets the coins or bills. Since some of our other friends are in on it they have started joking about how there will be a shortage of that particular bill because of me . And recently i have noticed that i have become much happier than around two years ago!

I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life and while going through graduate school 9 hours form home, knowing no one, I dealt with anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder. After finishing grad school, I struggled to find a decent job in my field. I was working terrible jobs that treated me poorly and I was miserable. I thought I wasted all of my time and money in grad school and that I’d never be successful. I got into an abusive relationship that destroyed my self worth and it ended with him cheating and emotionally abusing me. 

Fast forward to today and I realized just how lucky I am. I’ve been working what is essentially the closest thing to my dream job that I could imagine for the past couple of months, and I had been working towards this job for years. I was out on a boat working today with some coworkers and couldnt believe I got paid to do this. My job is in my field, makes an impact, helps me be financially secure, and makes me genuinely happy. Ive been dating the love of my life for over 2 years now, we bought a home together, and he’s going to be proposing soon. He is fiercely supportive of my dreams and is my biggest cheerleader. I have a decent core group of friends and for the first time, I have awesome coworkers who want to be friends and are super supportive. In the next year or two, my parents and hopefully my sister, BIL, and baby nephew will be moving down to my city. After 6 or 7 years I’ll finally get to be near my family again. 

I’m so content that I sometimes get anxious and worry - how could this be? What’s going to happen? Things are going almost TOO well. But...I’m going to enjoy it for now. I never in my entire life thought that I could be in a place like this in my life",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jf4lhz/im_finally_in_an_overall_good_place_after_years/,2020-10-21 02:41:39,1,2,0

hollabackchurl,I think I just passed my high school equivalency test,"I got a combined score of 70 on it and all I’m waiting for is the writing test. I think I finally did it. This year has sucked but it might be the year I finally get my drivers license, “graduate” high school and move into my own apartment. So far this year I moved into my own place, went full time at my job, passed my written drivers test and have finally taken my hse tests. I got a 20/20 on the reading portion so I’m sure I’ll  pass(obligatory humblest of brags).

Funny thing about it was during my placement for the classes for it back in February there was a power outage in the middle of the test. Then COVID everything shut down before I could schedule the damn thing.Then yesterday during the math and social studies tests there were 2 power outages. This was a CURSED adventure and it’s finally over. I have never been so proud of myself I walked back to my partners place and I couldn’t stop smiling when I saw them through the window.

I might be able to enroll in classes to pursue a nursing degree before the year is out. I could’ve done it without my partner, and they sure made me feel like it. Tonight they are going to get me a “generic high school graduation meal” from Cheesecake Factory.

Tonight, I was just sitting on a bench, talking on the phone with a friend. A guy came up to me, said he thought I was cute, and asked for my number. Not trying to be weird here, but he was a bit older (he looked about 20-something, not *creepy old* like the catcallers and stuff), so I quickly turned him down and told him I was too young. Of course, he just looked surprised and walked away.

Despite that, I actually feel like I have a chance! I've always feared that there was no hope for me, that I'll never attract someone that isn't a catcaller. Maybe this will be a good sign for the future :)

I hated playing piano, I hated cello, I hated everything because it became more of a chore than a passion or hobby. It sucked because those were things that I used to LOVE doing, I would be excited to come home from school to be able to learn my new piece on the piano.

I'm in college now and I came back for the weekend, and opened up the dusty piano and played a song I've been listening to for the past few months (Song for Sienna for those who want to know), and it brought me to tears to play the piano again.

During this time she teaches kids in China (part-time from home), makes us and the 4 kids breakfast, eats, cleans up, and jumps into homeschooling the kids with material I was never even taught. Somehow she also manages to paint every room in the house, pack our items (we are moving soon), clean much of the house, do dishes, sweeping, letting the dog in and out in and out, making dinner. During the course of some of these days she even finds time to film material for her yt channel which she started to help make us a little extra income. On top of all of that, she is a nurturing wife and mother, caring, and patient. I couldn't have asked for a better wife and I am glad that I get to stay home with her. If you are a husband reading this, hug your wife and tell her you appreciate her. If you are a wife or mom, thank you for all you do. You probably don't hear it as often as you should.

Vapodaca17,A fantastic birthday I attended for a new friend,"I was invited to go to a casino/hotel by one of my best friends because a coworker (who I liked just never knew that well or on a deeper level) was having other coworkers there for my birthday


I used to have two jobs and this was my ""secondary"" job or the part time one where the other was full. The other company went bankrupt so I was relieved I had this job to fall back on but because i had only focused on the work aspect of this job i had never really connected with anyone else on a more than coworker basis besides my best friend who worked there.


Recently I had been getting slowly closer with everyone and was excited because the other job felt like family and I wanted that for this job too because I missed it to be honest


Not only did me and that coworker really connect on a MUCH deeper level than 1. I expected or 2. Hoped for (not in a bad way) I set a 250 dollar limit for the casino because I felt comfortable I could lose that and be ok moving forward. I only bet 40 dollars in total and walked away with my rent money and was able to walk away without going up and all the way back down to possibly even losing money


This night was more than I could have ever hoped for with the new-found friendship and general great luck (also thought I lost my phone and luckily it was at the table I was sitting at barely hanging onto the chair before falling to the ground and possibly getting stolen)


Easily one of my favorite nights ever and just a very lucky night


Just wanted to share it because of how stoked I am. Hope everyone is doing ok and surviving through these crazy times. I dont know you, but I love you and wish for the best

reno140,Got hired at a company that actually values their employees!,"I’ve been in the workforce since I was 17 (I am 29 now), and I have worked in a variety of restaurants, retail stores, and therapy centers.

In my years in the workforce I have been USED and ABUSED by previous employers. I always give 150% to anything I do and just the lack of appreciation I have dealt with as well as the abhorrent working conditions I have been subjected to has made me quite cynical of all employers. No breaks, gaslighting from management, poor or no benefits and soul crushing work cultures are some examples. 

Last year I decided I was tired of bartending and waitressing and the abuse that came with it. I wanted to take steps towards a career in psychology so I hustled all year, saved up money, so I could move to a cheaper part of the state and immerse myself in my real career without having to struggle financially so much.

I finally; 3 months after moving, got a job with proper benefits such as healthcare, perks, a graduate scholarship program, and PAID TIME OFF which are all unthinkable luxuries to restaurant workers. All I can say is wow. I am finally hopeful for my future.

My whole life I've wanted to be a singer and actor(yes, I know, stereotypical), so I decided to try voice acting and at first, I got rejected a lot although I knew that was how it was going to be so it only hurt the first 4 times and then I decided to do some more research and then I realized I was just trying out for whatever regardless if it was in my voice range or it was the type of character I could act like. then basically I practised for the next few months and decided to audition for a few amateur jobs and asked for feedback most the time they didn't respond but a lot of the time they said it was my mic, and then I actually listened to all my auditions and realized how bad the mic quality was but I couldn't afford a mic(I'm broke people XD) and so I started using my headphones and I started to get a few jobs, my first one was the one that made me happiest and I wanted to put in more effort so that I could do it more and recently I've been getting accepted more and more and one day when I can actually afford a mic, I might audition for something more professional but I love all the ones I have right now and I will never forget the experience I got from them. This isn't a success story or anything I just wanted to share how happy I was about this :)

Well I think this time I was able to go full stupid and goofy without any overthinking.

I understand u might be confused by now so I'll tell u what happened. So basically I found someone a few days ago and it's like never before like I have been talking a full day during lectures and as soon as I wake up !! 

Like I have tried to talk to too many people untill now and I had lost all hope untill now but now I feel like it was worth if this goes as it is going now.

Just complete craziness all day, sharing the food we are having to doing stuff while talking with each other from talking from as soon as we wake up to talking till we get tired at night it just feels perfect ☺️

Idk maybe it's nothing for u people but that's all I have ever asked for and now that I have found it I will try anything to keep it.

Monica-Hernandez,FIVE TIPS THAT WILL LET YOU FEEL HAPPY EACH DAY,"*1. Don’t touch your smartphone (at least at night)*

A study published in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision found that people who use their cell phones at work after 9 p.m. feel more pressure the next day than people who carry a smartphone to work the next day. The reason is simple: processing work and responsibilities before bedtime makes it harder for the brain to shut down and almost impossible to relax in our dreams altogether.

cptwacky,A Local Night Workers Union (title in progress),"I am celebrating my latest idea that I am positive will bring me, and others, happiness! I work graveyard shifts and found that depression comes very easy as graveyard shift workers voluntarily resign half of their social life for work. We can not hang out with friends late at night partying and we can not join others half the time during the day because we must sleep during the day.

My brilliant idea is a local graveyard shift group! We meet up after our shifts and have food and drink like normal day shift workers do. The result is an improvement not only in my life, but others with a similar fate. Not really a help group, but we certainly will. Its more to regain some normalcy in our lives and make friends that find themselves in a similar situation.

I called around to poll to see if it was a good idea and if night workers would come. I just got off the phone with a lot of them and every single response was very positive! I just cried tears of joy in this discovery.  I had to share. I want to scream it from roofs and mountaintops. Just the prospect in this moment and its future possibilities MAKE ME HAPPY!

Now I am giddy with excitement to find a locale to host us regularly. What fun. Here's to a bright future to look forward to! I wish the same for all...",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/j92xlu/a_local_night_workers_union_title_in_progress/,2020-10-11 10:10:07,1,2,0

ViedeMarli,"It may not be exciting to some, but it makes me so happy that I finally know how to mod one of my favorite games!!","It seems like such a dumb thing to be happy over, I know, but I've always wanted to mod a home into a video game I've been playing for a few years now (I'm keeping it vague because I don't want to break the rules but, the game's well known for its modding community, it's single player, and it's... ""realistic""). For what feels like forever, I couldn't find any tutorial that would make the kinda terrifying experience of making said home + mod a little less, well, terrifying, but I finally did, and I'm ecstatic! 

I wish I was joking but I just became so overwhelmed with happiness over changing the model of a large item I needed inside the house to something different and smaller than the original so that it would better fit inside that I flailed my arms around lol. I thought another modder that did something similar was a wizard, and that I'd have to go into like, 3D modeling software and pick apart the game files but nope, it was as easy as just changing the model in the program that helps create the mod/home. 

Nobody else really cares about this kind of stuff around me, so I just had to share it with someone. Figured this was the best place to do it, even if only one person sees it! 

Go me! I'm going to have the **best** house in the (game) world now (to me anyway, because I made it myself, with a lot of TLC and troubleshooting). :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/j8wzgl/it_may_not_be_exciting_to_some_but_it_makes_me_so/,2020-10-11 02:02:28,1,3,0

captaindrom,"I was 300 Pounds, Extremely sick, had terrible friends in 2018/19, and now : I’m a completely different person.","I’m just really grateful.

My boyfriend (21M) and I (20F), have come a really long way in our relationship. He has matured a lot, and I’m happy to support him. I realized a lot of his passive behavior and immaturity came from depression he didn’t want to identify with. I made the choice to stay, and I thought the healing already started last year, but I realize it’s actually happening now. 

I was 300 pounds  and an undiagnosed type 1 diabetic as of last December. I’m now 230, and working out daily to now turn left over fat into muscle. I’m doing really well in college, have my cat Tinkerbell living with me, and gratefully unemployment has been keeping me a float. I plan on moving to another state with my partner, or without, to continue my dream of joining a trade school. 

I dance more often now. I have cut off nearly every friend I had in high school, as well as my boyfriend from his own group, because growing up meant realizing some people didn’t want to see you succeed. Gratefully, unemployment has given us thousands of dollars while our families are helping support us to stay a float in these troubling times (but trust me I’m looking for work everyday.) I can move all by myself and still be okay, and pay my own bills now. I have old friends who had been actual bullies, who still have nothing. And realizing those people didn’t belong in my life, made me the woman I am today. I’m just grateful to not be rude or degrading like they are. I’m just grateful I left the mix of things, because 2 years ago I was depressed and crying daily that I missed them so much. It was so much better to let go, because I’m much slimmer, smarter, faster, and I just... I’m flying. 

And now I have thousands saved, a stronger bond with the current love of my life, and soon a career to start. 

I’m just happy. Of course my relationship needs work, because we’re both always going through changes and we’re young. And working out with my health and body image isn’t always easy every day. But I am happy. I have my love, life, and family, and my kitty. I’m just happy. I’m grateful.

Vardalia,Being greatful for what you have is the secret to being happy,"Life is good right now for us: We buried St. Joseph in the ground in hopes of selling my 1000 foot house which has gotten too small for us. As a family of 6, who knew the kids would grow, acquire more space, and eat more food?! Plus we will be moving in with my in-laws so a house large enough to accommodate all of us would be difficult to find. Now we've always been practicing Christians, and we teach to pray not only when you need something, but also in thanks. We prayed for our house to sell and for an offer we made on a bigger house to be accepted. They had to happen at the same time, or else the offer would fall through if my house was not also sold. So what happened? As I buried St. Joseph and prayed, a flock of geese flew over me headed towards the south. I felt at peace, sitting in the grass with the sunset just peaking over the horizon. I went back into the house and I kid you not, my phone rang. We had several offers on our house and our dream house accepted our offer!! It was, and still is, a very surreal moment for us. If you are religious and you are reading this, God is good. If you are reading this and you are not religious, God is real. I don't want to make this post about religion but I wanted to give my advice. Be greatful. Love your spouse, cherish your kids, and enjoy the moments that make up what we call life. If you are in a bad situation, work your butt off to get out of it. God helps those who help themselves. Don't accept bad people into your life. We are not here very long. I am 43 years old with 4 kids. Yesterday I was 4 playing with matchboxes in my parents backyard on their retaining wall. If you love what you have, you will never want. Easier said than done, but that is the challenge. I am greatful I get a paycheck every 2 weeks, and I am greatful that, for now, I get to work from home. I am greatful for all the additional time we spend with our kids, whether if be board games, walks, participating in their TikTok videos, or us writing a skit together (or cleaning together) on our youtube channels. Every moment is important, and every step is part of a plan. Your life is how it is supposed to be. You are where you need to be in order to grow. Make choices, even difficult ones, to steer your life in the best position to help yourself and others.  -- Mike from CT, USA.

BausofHogs,"I know 2020 has been hard for a lot of people, buts it's been the best year of my life.","In January the company I was working for got bought out and I got laid off, not a good start lol. That weekend an old buddy from highschool wanted to hang out. I'm pretty introverted, like I was social distancing before it was popular, but I decided to go out anyway, better than sitting at home depressed.
He ended up offering me a job, and I started that Monday. I've been working there since and am loving it. Most fulfilling job I've ever had.
In March I bought a new car. I've never had a new car only used pieces of junk, so it was a big step forward. Making payments instead of constant repairs is by far the way to spend your money on transportation. 
My gf graduated 3 days ago. Well she graduated a few months ago but couldn't test due to covid, so just tested and passed a few days ago.
We got a house and moved everything thing in over the last 2 days, today will be all organization. It's quite nice for my standards, 3 bedroom, nice yard in a good neighborhood. I'm very excited. I feel like I'm finally becoming an adult, all because I decided to step out of my shell and go hang out with a friend I hadn't seen in a long time.

onepercenty,We did it! We got a place to live! Tomorrow my fanily will have a home!,"We are soon to be a family of 4. Me, my husband, our 3 year old son, and our second son will be born in january. After losing our home unexpectedly, having to move in with my mother who has been mentally/verbally abusive towards me my whole life, being rejected by every single place i applied for (credit problems from past abusive relationship), sometimes looking 6-8 hour hours straight a day for somewhere to go just to be rejected over and over, almost being hospitalized for suicidal thoughts... 

WE DID IT. WE HAVE A HOME. 

But it gets better.

Due to my credit problems, we were looking for a small 2 bedroom, in an awful area, because its easier to get approved over there. 

We ended up with a 3 bedroom, 1200sqft townhouse!!! And i LOVE IT. Its still not in the best area, but WAY better than where i thought i was going to end up. Its bigger than where i thought id end up with. Its prettier than where i thought id end up with. And its still under budget. It also has a new kitchen. 

The ONLY reason i got in is because the landlord and i seemed to click, so i opened up about my past abuse and explained how it effected my credit. Turns out his other tenant also has severe ptsd and agoraphobia so hes very understanding. He told me no matter what our credit was like, as long as we passed criminal checks and made 3x the income, it was ours. We got the final approval yesterday at 1pm. WE GET OUR KEYS TOMORROW!!! 

Moving on 48 hour notice is overwhelming BUT WORTH IT. Every penny we have is going into the moving expenses BUT ITS WORTH IT. 

Im so happy that i dont have to be homeless. I dont have to live with my abusive mother. My kids will have extra space. THEY GET A PLAY ROOM! And we get a fresh start in a house we love. 

I guess sometimes things do work out!
Now im actually excited for the future!

When I (f27) was a kid my step-sister and I spent time living at an apartment complex. Turns out a girl from my school lived in the same complex, so we became pretty close and played together a lot. I believe her mother was in jail and had been since her infancy but I’m hazy on that info. So she, (5th grader?) had to share a bed with her overweight and disabled grandmother in a small apartment. Well one day I had to go to the park because I needed to meet up with another girl classmate of ours and discuss a school project we were put together for. We of course invited my friend to come along since chances like that were probably few and far between given her grandmothers condition. Well our classmates  parents met my friend and eventually.. they adopted her! So she went from a shared bed in a tiny apartment to a nice house, her own room, two parents and a sister. She eventually attended college, graduated, and is now happily married in what looked like a beautiful ceremony. It’s a shame we aren’t still friends but I’m so happy for the life she got to have that started with a trip to the park that very possibly altered the entire course of her life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/j301ur/brought_a_disadvantaged_friend_to_the_park_one/,2020-10-01 02:28:20,1,2,0

sickient,"I wanted to share a short article I wrote about why loving yourself is the best thing you can do for the world. May this inspire all of us to be kinder to ourselves during these difficult times, because its the single most important thing we can do! ❤❤","# Love Yourself and Watch the World Love You Back

Loving yourself is the one greatest act you can offer the world. When you abide in self-love, you feel happy, fulfilled, and enough. From such a positive place, you will be much kinder and more empathetic towards others, more flexible and open-minded towards life’s challenges, and generally feel much more confident and optimistic towards life. Today, I’d like to share how to love yourself, become the object of your love, and transform your life experience into a happy and loving one.

# Love Your Body

Your body is the one physical entity that you must carry with you from birth till death, so it makes sense to love your body unconditionally and care for it the best you can. When the body is well taken care of, it feels comfortable, strong, and is free from distress. This leads to a higher state of being where one can flourish and do anything one wants to do because the body is no longer a physical barrier. For our bodies to serve us in achieving our goals and maximizing our quality of life, we must learn to harmonize with it, listen to it, and treat it affectionately with its long term wellbeing in mind.

Here is a list of things to care for our bodies and keep it optimized.

1. **Get plenty of rest** – Sleep as much as your body needs every night so you always wake up feeling refreshed, energized, and ready for the day’s work. Sleep early when possible and wake up naturally without an alarm. When you wake up early, the morning won’t feel rushed and you will have time to tend to your morning activities at a leisure pace. When you master your sleep, you’ll have established a solid foundation.
2. **Drink plenty of water** – The body needs water to flush out toxins and to keep your bodily organs hydrated and operating optimally. By replacing your fluids with water, you cut out all unnecessary sugars that are creating imbalances in the body. Water keeps the body fresh and the mind sharp so always have a bottle of water with you at all times.
3. **Exercise regularly** – This one is well understood to have major benefits and for good reason. Exercise deepens our breath to oxygenate the body, strengthens our muscles to increase metabolism, and releases endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin to put us in a positive mental state. Exercise doesn’t need to always be intense and uncomfortable. Find a pace that suits you and work up from there. Be gentle to yourself, enjoy your practice, and be consistent.
4. **Have healthy eating habits** – You are what you eat because your food becomes your body. Eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, less processed foods, and observe your body’s reaction to the foods you eat. Everyone has different food requirements and intolerances and it’s important that we know what works for us. Are you lactose intolerant? Gluten intolerant? How does your body react to excess sugary foods and oily foods? When the food you eat leads to bloating, inflammation, and general discomfort, it may be a sign your body is being harmed. This is one of the major factors in physical distress. Love your body by feeding it high-quality foods. Finally, allowing your body to rest in between meals will help the body enter ketosis autophagy to stimulate weight loss and self-healing.
5. **Optimize your environment** – Keep your living and working space clean and introduce some life into it in the form of plants and animals. Having some pot plants and maybe a small fish tank around will make your environment much more soothing and pleasant. This will do wonders for your body as it helps you maintain a parasympathetic state meaning you feel safer, happier, and more relaxed.

# Love Your Mind

When the body is healthy and comfortable, you can turn your attention to your mind and nourish it with all the conditions that make it joyful, peaceful, and free from stress and anxiety. A person with a healthy mind will navigate through life skillfully, treat others with kindness and consideration, have more capacity to handle greater things, and feel overall more confident and optimistic. A healthy mind is strong in qualities such as will power, patience, joy, compassion, motivation, and wisdom.

Here is a list of things to show our minds plenty of love and care.

1. **Consume good content** – Social media is here to stay and we may as well embrace it. We should use it to serve us by consuming positive and wholesome content instead of wasting our time on content that adds no value to our lives. Consume enriching content to develop new skillsets, see the positives in the world, and learn how we can make a positive impact on ourselves and the people around us. Our time on social media should leave us energized and optimistic, not lethargic, and directionless.
2. **Spend more alone time** – We don’t spend enough time with ourselves these days. It’s important to be alone every now and then, free from external expectations, to recharge and reconnect. Spending a few hours each week in meditation, walking in the park, or just relaxing at home quietly alone will help us understand more of how we feel, what we want, and what we should do. When the mind is quiet and still, we will learn more about ourselves.
3. **Be around positive, empowering people** – We are the average of the five people we spend most of our time with. This is because we are social creatures who are easily influenced by our surrounding environment. Be around people who are uplifting, generous, and happy, and their energy will rub off on us in all the right ways. Limit our time with those who are cynical, pessimistic, and sabotaging and we remove a great source of negativity from our lives.
4. **Practice deep breathing** – During moments of stress, anxiety, and discomfort, take a few deep breaths before deciding a reaction. Deep breathing will instantly bring ease to the mind, comfort to the body, and allow you to enter a parasympathetic state where you will be in a position to make better decisions. If you can incorporate deep mindful breathing throughout the day, you will see great benefits!
5. **Continue growth and development** – It is important that we are constantly learning something new and improving different areas of our lives every day. Make it a habit to focus on several internal and external long-term goals that make life meaningful and exciting. Learn a new skillset or language, cultivate a few inner virtues, and spend some time improving yourself every day. There is a lot of fulfillment in personal development.

# Conclusion

The biggest impact we can make on our families, our careers, our social circles, and the world itself, is to show ourselves love and attention. When we take care of ourselves and raise our physical and mental wellbeing, we will be in a better position to look after others. When we are happy, our energy will feed off on others. When we are healthy, we have more strength and confidence to deal with anything life throws at us. When we have taken care of ourselves and have all we need, everything else can be used to serve our external goals and objectives. This is why the best thing you can do is to love yourself, and when you do, the world will be eternally grateful and give you all the love in return.

mega_mindful,2020 has been a good year for self care self improvement and bringing family together,"I’m 34 and 2020 may be my best year yet

Late last year I decided that 2020 would be my year of positivity and self improvement. 

Was this the worst year to do this? Maybe, but the political discord in the US, the global pandemic, and the wildfires that have been burning in my state for months have all taught me a hard lesson in radical acceptance. I can’t change any of these things. I can only take steps to keep myself and my family healthy and happy.

I just finished my MBA and I’m getting outside for exercise in the gorgeous Colorado sun. I’m taking my meds and seeing a therapist regularly. My marriage is better and stronger than it was this time last year. My house is beautiful and I’m slowly making improvements to it. I’m pursuing creative outlets like photography and graphic art.

I’ve had my moments of uncontrollable sobbing... most recently when RBG died. I still carried on with life and smiled even if I didn’t feel it inside and soon I felt myself feeling genuine happiness again.

The world may be spiraling, but right now my life is good. I’m grateful for the opportunities I’ve been given and I’m proud of my efforts.

Tara0022,I overcame my fear and conquered the stage!,"

So I've always wanted to be an actress, to act both on stage and in front of the cameras, but I was way to scared to fail and not be good at it, I wanted so bad to be ""a natural""... I got a call from one of my teachers and saying the school theatre group needed someone to fill in a spot (she knew I had a passion for this.). I refused on the spot, being too petrified to say yes, but then my boyfriend told me to go for it. I got defensive and we had a fight, until I realised that he was right, so I called the teacher and went through with it. Weeks later, we went to a national competition with a hard play, and to my biggest surprise, I won Best actress in a supporting role! Out of the whole festival, I won it! I'm really happy and wanted to share it with someone, since my friends and family don't really care for it.

flcks,My partner was told by his doctor that he is quickly recovering from a disease that was supposed to be fatal.,"Around a year ago, he was given a 40% chance of survival. We've been separated for more than half a year because of corona, and what's kept us going has been the thought of finally getting to hold each other again and start building our life together. But there's always been this looming uncertainty - what if we make it through this time of separation, but when we finally get to be together, he'll have to go too soon? It's been a crushing reality to live in... dreaming of a long, happy future with him but not even knowing if we'll get that far.

A few days ago, he went to see the doctor without me knowing - he said it was a dermatologist's appointment. He wanted to wait until he knew what the results of the tests were before telling me. And boy, they were so much better than we could've expected... he was told that since the previous tests a few months ago there's been incredible recovery taking place, and that he should be pretty much fully recovered in another 6 months. He was told that there's most likely going to be nothing stopping him from living a long, fulfilling life.

It feels surreal... suddenly not having to worry anymore. Knowing that it's all up to us now. It's crazy, and I'm feeling incredibly grateful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/j01sv3/my_partner_was_told_by_his_doctor_that_he_is/,2020-09-26 07:37:56,1,6,0

AleckLove,I'm happy to tell about my past achievements in life and how I accomplished them.," When I was 18 I weighed 395 pounds, I found this out stepping on the scale at the doctors office at a appointment. When I was in the second grade I had a thyroid problem which made me gain tons of weight in a little amount of time. I was an obese child and teen getting made fun of and picked on at school. When I got into high school I had friends and went out sometimes but being obese it was hard enjoying certain activities. The day I was at the doctors office I made a commitment to change, after the doctor told me being 395 pounds was not at all good for my health. I started on the Atkins diet eating lean meats, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. I started out walking for exercise but grew to love other forms of exercise such as weight lifting, yoga, aerobics, and especially jogging. In 8 months I lost 100 pounds I graduated high school with people amazed by the way I was looking I kept going and by the time I turned 21 I had lost 270 plus pounds. I was thrilled but had lots of excess skin on my body especially my tummy. I ended up getting skin removal surgery, which was painful but worth it. I think back at this goal and get very very happy. I never stopped loving exercise, I worked out the whole time I was pregnant. I'm currently training for my dream career for a better life for my son. Thinking back to this huge achievement I accomplished gives me the strength to train for my career. This makes me extremely happy, finally I shared my past with people instead of hiding it. I'm so so happy I finally told people about my skin surgery as well. I've had a huge smile on my face lately.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/iy5qbu/im_happy_to_tell_about_my_past_achievements_in/,2020-09-23 07:37:22,1,3,0

I didn't know what to do and i was the verge of losing my mind.

I spoke up. I asked for help from my family, i went to the doctor for the first time in 11 years, and i am currently on a healthy diet and mild medication.

The ringing inside my head is faint and not so bothersome anymore after 3 weeks of treatment, im already seeing massive improvements.

No more suicidal thoughts, no more depression. I'm very happy right now and i thank my stubbornness for allowing me to seek out some help.

HorrorificScallion,my boyfriend called me his best friend and it means the world to me,"my boyfriend of 2.5 years and I have been through some shit. through learning about him I've come to see that his friends are his family and his family is the most important thing in the world to him beyond all measures. we are in a ldr at the moment and I just got home after spending two weeks with him and we mega chilled. ate like shit got drunk a lot and played a lot of video games and I even got to hang out with his mom and sisters for a bit too. it was wonderful with lazy mornings and calm late nights. we really just hung out. and talked and joked. without pressure without worrying about our future. it was like visiting a friend. when I got there I gave him a letter and he didnt read it until today during his lunch break and I cant remember what I put in it but I remember crying while writing it. anyways he sent me a voice message and he said I was his best friend. he has said it before, but I felt it this time. it makes my heart swell every time. his friends that he grew up with are such a huge part of his soul and I just feel so so honored to be included in that. with the ldr, some parts of our relationship have grown while others haven't and these past two weeks I feel like a fucking sim that became best friends with another sim. that bond is there now and it's the coolest shit. I wouldn't trade it for anything. I know I want this life with him.

throwaway_away_12,My therapist told me I graduated therapy!,"I stopped going to therapy for a year and a half, leading to a massive spiral and depressive episode. I suffered from some traumatic things growing up so I was pretty much in freefall. I was encouraged to go back by my mum and I finally found the therapy that worked for me (EMDR). I went back around one year ago, starting out doing talk therapy and then going onto EMDR around April, and have been doing masses of amounts of work every week in a very intense way.

My therapist told me that the work I've put in has not been in vain. She took out her notebook and looked at the goals I had at the beginning of EMDR. I had completed them all. She told me she was super proud of me and that I've gotta go live my life and enjoy it (and that she would always be there if I needed to go back for whatever reason)! 

I feel extremely happy and elated. This feels so different to the moment when I decided to stop going to therapy those years ago. I feel strong, capable, and free from the trauma I went through.

ImAMotherfuckinBoss,"I ASKED someone to take a picture of me for the first time in a long time. And after looking at it, I felt really good and it made my realize that I'm really happy with my life for the first time probably ever","A few weeks ago, I asked my partner to take a picture of me while we were sitting on the beach. It's been a year since I asked someone to take a picture of me because I thought I looked nice, and before that, MUCH longer. 

It's not a genuine smile from me, more my ""let's take a picture"" smile, but I couldn't figure out how to get my smile right when he took it so it's the best I could do.

The happiness with my life just sorta creeped up on me.

Over the past year, I've lost 90lbs. I still have a long way to go, but never in my life did I ever think I could actually do it. 

I live in the town I always dreamed of living in as a kid, and I live in an awesome house that's in the perfect location and is the perfect size. 

I have pets that bring me joy and enrich my life.

I was recently offered and started the job I've been after for 3+ years and I love it. I love the day-to-day tasks, and the overall work. 

I have an amazing partner who sees me and hears me. I trust him completely and show him my 100% complete genuine self everyday; and everyday he loves me and cherishes me. And in return, he gives me his complete genuine self and I get to love and protect the trust he puts in me the same. We've been together for almost seven years and every so often I realize I love him so much more and even deeper than I ever thought I could. 

I started going to counseling several years ago because everything was starting to burst at the seams for me. I've learned so much about myself. But also, I've learned so much about how to handle difficult situations and navigate tough relationships. It's freed me from so many situations since then where I would have put so much energy into something that wasn't worth it, or something that just wasn't my responsibility. 

My mental health holds me back from checking things off my daily to-do list and my overall life to-do list at the rate that I want to be checking things off. And it's really hard not to spend my time wishing things were different, and that I could just do what I want to do when I want to do it. But then I look at all that stuff up there and realize two things. 

1. I CAN check things off, the pace doesn't change how good it feels once it's done
2. It really doesn't even matter, I have what I need. Everything else is just extra toppings for $.99

If you're hanging by a thin thread, I just want you to know that there was a time once years ago when I was having suicidal thoughts. This happiness right now, as small as it is, was worth waiting for.


If I could go back in time to those days, I'd tell myself ""Talk to a psychiatrist and a therapist, read everything you can on depression, anxiety, trauma, anger management, and raising self-esteem, cut yourself some slack for being an imperfect human being (it doesn't make you an asshole or a failure), physically do things to work on yourself, give yourself a lot of time, and have faith that these things are causes which will eventually yield results you'll enjoy.""

umichpremed,Becoming a bone marrow donor is a fairly easy process and can save the life of a patient!,"Blood cancer is a difficult diagnosis for anyone affected by it, but becoming a donor is extremely easy! All you have to do is go online, fill out a short health questionnaire, and a swab kit will be sent to you. The entire process takes less than 15 minutes altogether. If you are in the US you can swab here: [***Gift of Life***](https://www.giftoflife.org/dc/LakshmiM)

Giving Bone Marrow isn’t like what you see on Grey’s Anatomy. There are a lot of myths about bone marrow donation. 80% of donors are asked to give peripheral blood stem cells, which is very similar to that of a platelet donation or blood drawing process. The remaining 20% give bone marrow cells which are taken straight from the donor’s hip, but this is done under sedation and is relatively painless except for some soreness/achiness that may last for a little while. This procedure is mostly asked for younger patients/children.

Why you should care:

\-Every 3 minutes a child or adult is diagnosed with blood cancer. It can affect anyone, from children, to healthy adults, to grandparents. A bone marrow or stem cell transplant is the only hope for survival for many of those diagnosed, and can be a CURE for some.

\-Over 70% of those in need do not have a match within their family and need to find a donor on the registry.

\-Recipients that are part of a minority group have the hardest time finding a donor on the registry. Only 25% of black or multi-racial patients will have a donor on the registry, 40% of Asian-American, and 45% of Hispanic/Latinx. Their best chance is finding someone with a similar ethnic background. We need more diversity on these registries!

\-There is a 1 in 200 chance that you will need a bone marrow or stem cell transplant in your life time.

\-Stem Cell/Bone Marrow Transplants can be used to treat/cure many blood cancers as well as immune and blood disorders.

\-There is a 1 in 200 chance you will be called as a potential match and 1 in 5 potential matches will be asked to become a donor.

Becoming a bone marrow donor can lead you to saving someone else's life, who is going through unbelievably tough times and will save their family/friends as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ir468t/becoming_a_bone_marrow_donor_is_a_fairly_easy/,2020-09-12 02:08:49,1,6,0

questionableduck,I re-met my old online best friend from nine years ago,"TLDR at Bottom

Back in 2014, I was 12 years old playing Minecraft and 7 Days to Die on Xbox Live and PC with my best friend (xzRangerC)  we were friends for years at that point, We were crappy builders though, but we had lots of Imagination so we built 300-500 buildings on our city world. And we just got 7 Days to Die and we loved it because it was a Minecrafty type game. When we were playing Minecraft one day I remember Him saying that he had to go to bed, so we agreed to get on at a certain time Tomorrow and agree to get offline for now. 

I wake up the next day, play Risk with my dad for 3 hours and I plop down on the couch with some chips and Pepsi then watch The Star Wars Clone Wars show. I hop on Xbox at the time we agreed on, he isn’t on. So I start building for about 2 hours and he isn’t on. I thinks he might just be busy so I get off. 

One week later: Nothing

One Month Later: Nothing

One Year Later Nothing:

Fast forward 6 years later, Insert me playing State of Decay 2. I get bored and make a looking for group post, I say “Grinding for Daybreak Operators and Prefabs, Trading modded Guns”

I get an Interested from 2 people, they were pretty cool and I liked playing with them. Another person got interested about 30 minutes later so I just decide to help them because we need help with Daybreak. I invite him and recognize his voice, But I thought nothing of it. Everyone starts talking about The 7 year old State of Decay 1. We talk about the map and the journal feature, then we start talking about 7 Days to Die and how it’s console support is dead. I start talking about my friend who I used to play with a lot, the 3rd guy that joined said “Yeah I had a friend that I played Minecraft with a lot. We had two humongous wool statues of our favorite skins. (That was our survival) And I simply said “Ranger?”  He replied “No way” At this point I couldn’t speak because My smiling just stopped me. We played for the rest of the night. We talked about our old Minecraft worlds and 7 Days To Die, He had to get a new account because his house got robbed and he forgot his Microsoft Email and Password. So he bought a new Xbox a couple years later and made a new account, I changed my Old Gamertag. 


TLDR: My online  best friend went permanently offline after his house got robbed, he forgot his account details and made a new one, I made a new gamertag so he couldn’t find me.

nabbyy10,A nice change of pace brought on by who knows what.,"

I’ve been pretty down for a good long bit. A good 3 years of constant drudgery. From major depressive episodes to explosive emotional setbacks. These past two days have been phenomenal. I have no memories of being this at peace in any other time in my life. And it’s not for any particular reason. I tend to attempt rationalizing things no matter how tedious it is, so naturally I assumed this was due to a recent surgery. I had my wisdom teeth removed, and I assumed I was 
A) I was coming off of the effects of anesthetics and my brain was just becoming more active over a period of a couple days. 
B) not feeling as much pain in my jaw or 
C) I was not eating as much, so I didn’t feel as lethargic.

I then broke the day down.

I went fishing for the first time since the surgery and a friend came with me. She didn’t fish, she just hung out and read a book while I fished. I had company. It was 78 F out. The water was very high, and there was a constant breeze. Not too much sun, ever so slightly interrupted by clouds. I caught four fish, 3 baby striped bass and a snook. Nothing big or spectacular. I hadn’t lost any gear, my knife didn’t get wet. I wasn’t tired afterwards, I didn’t get sunburned, I wasn’t hungry, I wasn’t dehydrated. We were in a semi isolated spot that couldn’t be seen from the rest of the park. I drank a small mango smoothie. I listened to music and laughed. And I was happy. I was filled with a grand euphoria of which I have never known.

I was in bliss.

And I was the next day too. But what happened that 
next day?

Nothing of note. At least to anyone without a habit of over-analyzing.

I rode my bike and picked up a prescription from the pharmacy. I rode my bike through town to pick up some soap. I realized I left my card at home and went back to get it. I returned and bought my soap and came home. A suture from surgery fell out of my mouth. Nothing happened that was out of the ordinary. And yet this day I felt such peace and happiness.

These past two days have been the best I’ve experienced in the past 6 years of my life. I have never    Felt such peace and bliss. And I don’t know why. If it wasn’t the little things, what was causing such joy within me?

Maybe such a pure and meaningless joy is somewhat foreign to me in recent years. That’s okay, I suppose. I’m happy. And I haven’t felt this good in so long.

I never want it to end. It will, but that won’t stop me from trying.

Thankfully this happiness bout has come about right after... something. I genuinely don’t know how to describe what happened.

Remember aforementioned friend? Maybe a couple of weeks before the last couple of days she said “you are tired, aren’t you? You seem, like, hollow. Full of static.” I asked what she meant and she said, “I don’t know, it’s just like a light in your eyes.” I stood up and walked home. And I don’t know what she meant.

This change of pace is a welcome one. It’s so entirely minor and insignificant. But I’m loving not dragging my unwilling soul behind me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/io10z9/a_nice_change_of_pace_brought_on_by_who_knows_what/,2020-09-07 04:39:47,1,2,0

JasmineHodgess,What are some suggestions for things to do daily for one to feel happy? Here are some things I do that work for me.,"\- **Get into nature**. Take a short walk, eat lunch outside, go to a park for a half hour, even open a window and listen to the rain. Taking a few minutes to connect with the natural world help me feel grounded and relaxed.

* **Meditation.** At first it was very difficult to sit still for that long. But after the first week, I started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head. I was perceiving things poorly, from past images that I’d clung onto.
* **Yoga.** Please look after your body as well as your life! Follow your internal compass — your intuition. If something feels right, you’ll know. Even more poignantly, like in yoga, if something feels wrong, you’ll know for certain. When you’re practicing yoga, the movements at hand require a level of focus that demands that you be in the present moment. The practice pulls you from your thoughts because it is stronger than them.Getting into your body in this way is an antidote for rumination and a soother of worry. There are times to think, but during yoga, you are only required to move, and it requires your full participation.
* **Ritual.** For me, it’s making an afternoon cup of tea. Having a small ritual like this that you do at the same time every day provides a touchstone in the day. It’s best if the ritual is a healthy one, of course (i.e., not lighting up a cigarette or pouring a drink).
* **Avoid drama and the people who cause it**. Drama is what I call the manufactured junk that causes conflict and unhappiness. Some people seem like they must always be submerged in drama. My husband and I decided long ago that we weren’t going to tolerate it. We don’t befriend people who bring drama, and we work to keep it out of our relationship. It helps us deal much better with the real ups and and downs of life.
* **Try to maximize time spent on activities that induce «flow.»** Flow is the term for that magical time when you’re so immersed in what you’re doing that you don’t really notice the time passing. We are happiest when we are in flow. So when you do something and realize this is happening, make a mental note of it, and try to build time into your days for similar activities.

If you are interested, there’s a lot out there to get you started. I recommend the mindfulness&amp;yoga apps but please find what suits you. If you have any apps or sites you want to share, please do!

TruestOfThemAll,"Not much of a sob story here, but a really cool thing that makes me feel like I'm actually growing up.","When I was a kid and went swimming sometimes there would be guys, teenagers or older, who would as a game to humor the kids pretend to be sea monsters and try to flip over whatever the kids were floating on.

Well, tonight I was that guy. I was swimming across a lake and on my way back there were some kids on a paddleboard, and after I jokingly said I was a shark they tried to run me over with their board so I played that game with them as the sea monster.

nessa19x,I did it. I finally made it and it took buying a purse and wallet to register... I truly escaped poverty.,"Honestly I just needed a place to vent how drastically happy a simple purchase made me today. 

I work as a Paramedic (in Canada) and have for a year now but I just bought my second Michael Kors item. Sounds stupid that a mere purse and wallet excited me so much but it's not about the items at all.

I grew up poor as hell before my mother clawed her way up to the high end of the low income tax bracket. I remember she was making 28,000$/ year when I was in high school which we thought was fantastic considering she had me as a teen and started on welfare while I was a baby. My mother truly worked her ass off to get that far. I know all too well what it was to go without lunches so my much younger brother would never have to. I remember the power shut off several times, we moved a lot, etc. Not the worst life but far from comfortable. 

I initially followed a similar path to my mum of low income and ended up in shit relationships and so forth until I decided to join the Canadian Army at 22. Since that I was injured, medically released, married the man I met in my platoon that I love, got sponsored retraining meaning I owe zero student loan debts, we have a house, bought my first financed new suv, and overall we are quite comfortable with our combined income. I'm truly doing stuff I really never saw happening in my life. The fact I don't have to stress about which bill to pay anymore or how much food I can afford, etc is mind-blowing to me. 

All that said I just bought my second item from the designer I've always adored which if you'd told me that even 2 years ago I would never believed it. I didn't have to save, I didn't have to do the whole ""do I REALLY love it and will I use it enough to justify this price"" thing like I used to for many things... I just clicked add to bag. 

I really sincerely never thought I'd see the day and it truly reminds me just how incredibly far I've come. I didn't even really get hit like this when I bought my car which is a VW Tiguan ... A brand my mother scolded me for being a ""rich person car"" once lol... I know it's not but she was so concerned about the cost of it and maintenance because I don't think she really realized just how far my finances have come until we went on a girls vacation recently. All the money I've loaned and given her and she really didn't ""relax"" until then. 

It's just so overwhelming knowing I escaped. I escaped genuine poverty despite the odds. It's only up from here and I am already looking into buying a rental property to add to our income without my husband or I having to commit to another busy job... An added security blanket as well since his back is quite bad already... But I know without doubt we will be stable should he need to change careers and it's the most accomplished I've felt to date.

I'm just so fucking grateful to have made it this far it but me like a ton of bricks. I may not be ""wealthy"" by any means but internally I feel rich.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/imcyjp/i_did_it_i_finally_made_it_and_it_took_buying_a/,2020-09-04 09:36:12,1,27,0
VodkaAunt,I snuggled a cat for the first time in my life!,"For context - I've had pretty severe asthma my entire life, which is often triggered by my allergies to animal dander. Any time in my life that I was ever around animals, any animal at all, I would only really last a few minutes or so before breaking out in hives, even if I didn't come into physical contact with them. With direct contact, or a couple hours just being in close proximity, I typically end up having a terrible asthma attack.

Problem is, *I love animals*. I'm a very physical person, I absolutely love snuggling, and animals are all just so cute and cuddly that it's been so painful to not be able to be around them my whole life! 

I've tried all sorts of medications all throughout my life, and a few months ago, started two new ones, and later my allergist doubled the doses of each. 8 months ago I nearly had to be hospitalized just from being in a friend's house where cats lived, but today -

*TODAY I SNUGGLED A CAT!*

Guys, it's great. It's fantastic. He was the cutest, friendliest cat in the entire world, and I didn't have any reaction! It was honestly, genuinely one of the best moments of my life.

Morganike,I'm addicted to waving at truckers. It makes me happy and brightens up my days.,"It happened this summer. My father had his birthday in July and he is a trucker. I know his route so I thought why not go and wave to him from an overpass. So I went and before he arrived I started waving to all truckers and woah.. almost everyone waved back or blasted their horn. It felt so good to me that even after my father passed I stayed there for hours. And now I do this every week at least once (usually more). Im a gamer myself but honestly when it is good weather outside I just ride my bicycle to an overpass and wave for a couple of hours. I usually go to the same spot so I already have ""regulars"". I know exactly when they are coming and I can see them smiling when Im there.

Confused? Here’s the deal. While many listen to anxiety audios to relax or seek out that cool “shiver” that comes along with satisfying aural treats, as it turns out, many folks listen to these audios for entirely different reasons. Some of those include role-playing with a fictional boyfriend—not that there’s anything wrong with that.

corp_minion_no1,We finally launched our project today that we have been working on for the last year and half,"After working at a major us telcom for almost 15 years, I finally launched a project that was not a directional tool or given direction on how to build. 

I started on the phones in a call center almost 15 years ago and have worked my way through multiple degrees and promotions. It feels so flipping validating all the hard work to see my project that I created from scratch with my 4 awesome developers come to fruition. Also it feels amazing to all those who tried to manipulate the project into something that was not a good experience.

 Even though my company is pretty good with inclusion, being a female project manager has made me get some tough skin quickly and to not allow other to speak for me. It is awesome to speak and say the final word, while having the backs of my team. 

I am so proud of our team and these people I have never met in real life but call my friends now.  We finally did it!!

HWKramerVO,Five Years Makes One Hell of a Difference,"Just a happy little moment occurred to me this morning. 

Five years ago I was lonely, overweight, horribly depressed and didn't even know it, unsure of my place in the world, and scared to follow my passion for voice acting. Now I am in a wonderful and healthy relationship, have numerous friends whom I love and support and who in turn love and support me, in great shape (at least, healthy enough. Sadly, I do not have galloping abs yet), confident and calm despite the pandemic turning the world upside down, and I've been working full time as a voice actor for the last 6 months, after juggling waiting tables, theatre, AND voice acting jobs for the last five years, and have a total of SIX BOOKS scheduled to record over the course of the next three months.

I'm grateful to everyone I've met along this journey, learned so much, and am happy with where I've come, and I'm excited for where I will go. The future is vast, unknowable, and chaotic. That's what makes it so fun. I hope that everyone is able to keep moving forward, and strive to reach their goals and aspirations. It's a crazy world out there, so I'll do my best to give everyone a helping hand, and I hope you do the same.

veryverycoolguy123,I made a strangers day with a small act of kindness,"So this happened 20 minutes ago.

I was on my way back at home, waiting for the train to arrive. When it finally did a handful of people where about to leave, most of them standing there. A dude and a girl, maybe brother and sister, gf &amp; bf? stood up from their seats, which where located right at the exit, went to the doors and waited to get out. 

The trained moved slowly towards my direction, when it finally stopped, all those people went out and passed me, the dude and the girl left to left side. I hopped on and took the closed seats to get some rest from a long day.

And then.. there it was, a big black cellphone laying on the center of the seat, presenting itself to me. Very large phone, black cover, maybe an HUAWEI or a Samsung, definitely not an iPhone, no actual idea though. 

I knew there was only one thing to do, I knew exactly who this phone belonged to since I saw the dude and the girl leaving from those exact seats. I grabbed it, left the train to the right, started running and not even 20 metres away, there they were.

""Excuse me, is this yours?"", I asked them both. ""Oh my god, yeah, thank you, thank you."", the dude replied.

I told them it was just laying there so I figured they must have forgotten/lost it there, I hand it over, dude just says ""Thank you"" two more times and leaves.

I get back in the train with the happiest feeling ever. I actually felt over the moon because I know, if I had lost my phone on the god damn train, it would be so fucking sad and devastating. And also, in his position, I would be so thankful for a stranger returning my phone... Let's just hope it was actually his but I'm like 95% certain it was and I kinda trusted the dude.

I know I don't deserve anything for this, it was just a kind act of human decency but I'm still very very happy for this random dude who got his phone back and wanted to share :) I don't really have anyone to call and tell them so reddit will have to do!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ikl9w9/i_made_a_strangers_day_with_a_small_act_of/,2020-09-01 14:29:32,1,2,0

supriseanddelightt,A breakup between lovers that turned into friends.,"My partner and I were forced to separate. Which absolutely was/is heartbreaking. Neither of us wanted to separate.  The toxicity between us and the kids were overbearing and we would have just stayed stuck. At first, it was the most pain I've felt from having to leave someone I love. I haven't felt a pain like it.

Fast forward to now, tonight, we are in communication and have decided we are going to heal, together through this. As friends. And I am so humbled by this human being, to be able to put the personal feelings aside and look at the bigger picture, I am astonished. He is my best friend and I'm glad that we can navigate our breakup together and lean on eachother for support.

You can see how important their food was to me and why I was devastated when I saw that they closed seemingly forever. About a month ago, in a neighbouring village an asian restaurant opened and my mom and I checked it out. As they also recognized us, we got free sushi and chatted for a bit. Turns out that the previous place is being demolished and rebuilt and the proprietor's brother will open a restaurant there again. You cannot imagine how well I slept in a long time after that day. Of course the people of the school have been updated about the location. 
This story might have sounded silly or even childish but it really was a relief for me to find out that they are still operating a restaurant with the benefit of being up to 35km closer to my place. And I still get to eat their delicious noodles.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/iizazy/my_favorite_asian_restaurant_in_a_very_distant/,2020-08-29 20:12:13,1,3,0

_Athulu,I had the best day of my life this week and I'm so excited.,"I think everyone has had a hard 2020, me being no different with a lot of life stress, new job, family issues, and general unease in life, so it genuinely surprises me to say I had an amazing perfect day! 

It was Tuesday, I got to sleep in late ish, snuggles with the dog in bed and my SO brought me coffee in bed. Did my morning routine in perfect bliss, got a dog walk in, no stress and used a new soap I had made (tea tree oil and charcoal!).

Then my partner finished work early and we went to IKEA, bought a tonne of stuff on sale for our new flat and got an amazing deal. We picked up a couple of pizzas and beers on the way back to the flat and had an amazing time building flatpacks with drinks and food. I've never been so contented with my life before.

It sounds really simple, just a pleasant day, but it was one of those moments I have imagined all my life, being in a happy and loving relationship with my best friend and building furniture for our new place together with music banter and a takeaway.

Alienist404,I finally have real friends who are actually supportive of me,"I don't think it really sunk in with me. For 8 years I've only had one friend who somehow always put up with my antisocial bullshit. We're still best friends, but I finally have more than one friend!


I've really been actively working on myself for the past year and I recently realized that I gained 4 friends since then. One of them I have a strong emotional and intellectual connection to and I feel most safe sharing my heavy venting thoughts with her bc she has NEVER judged ME. Not a single awful thought has she negatively commented on. 


I was having an incredibly manic day today and got a lot of stuff done. Big mood swing fucked it up and I couldn't leave to go home, but I really had to. I've always sought strangers to spill my shit to so my friends won't know how crappy my brain is. But, I've realized, they do know. They know my mistakes and past and they're still here, offering a lending hand everytime I hint at the fact I'm not doing okay.


That still didn't encourage me to really open up to them in the moment I was actually feeling bad bc of incredibly shitty past experiences. So I tried calling with a random stranger and found it just, didn't work anymore. Not in a way that would matter to me. So I sent the aforementioned friend a text that I had to vent and she just listened and offered a few options on how she could help me. 


We ended up calling for THREE hours, half of which I was just really venting (I was so riled up that I couldn't be in the tram so I just ended up walking most of the way home in the rain). She listened to my entire past toxic friendship (which is really intense and complicated), let me repeat myself about some topics until I worked through it and gave me some advice here and there. 


After that we just had a pleasant chat about everything and nothing. I never run out of things to talk about with her and that's bc she can match me on whatever subject we're discussing. Our bond is really special to me, I've never been so on the same wavelength with another person. 


Today I can proudly say I have FIVE FRICKING FRIENDS who would absolutely support me through anything, as long as I'm willing to keep trying!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ihv5u2/i_finally_have_real_friends_who_are_actually/,2020-08-27 22:34:36,1,4,0

ethos111974,"How focus is building my confidence, helps to relieve stress, and has helped motivate me."," 

The power of focus... Focus breeds efficiency. Efficiency leads to less time spent doing tasks! This becomes especially important when involved in doing the tasks that are necessary but not our favorite things to do, right? Discipline obviously plays a key role in this paradigm, and the reason why all of this is so important to me today is because for most of my life, I had none of these! I went through a ten-year period turning my life around, letting go of childhood resentments, and ensuing trust and entitlement issues. The ability to truly be present, disciplined, and focused now like I wasn't able to do before means a lot to me today. The thing that I'm most grateful for is that now by being able to apply these principles in my own life, I'm accomplishing the goals I set out to do! Also, it's giving me a strong mental record of success, increasing my self-confidence, and even helping me lower or even eliminate stress over the duties I have.. I know I'm going to get it done. It's a win/win/win! I'm on my way to becoming a counselor now, and I feel a duty to honor all of the help that I was given by paying it forward!

bpd_bitch,I helped my immigrant father get a raise.,"My father is one of the hardest workers I know. I don't remember a time when his hand wasn't covered in callouses. He and my mother reached out to me and asked if I could write them a letter asking the CEO of the company he works at for a minor raise. The long and the short of it is that my father works the same position at the same company, just at a different location. When he transferred to the new location (which was closer to home), they reduced his pay by 3$. When he asked his manager for a raise, he was denied. He wanted to take the request straight to the top, to the CEO of the entire company.

Being immigrants, my parents have enough English to get them through the day, but they lack the more complex or niche language skills. That's where I come in - I drafted up a letter and sent it over to my mom who rewrote the letter word by word since she doesn't know how to operate a printer. They express-mailed it and today they called me saying he got the raise.

If I'm honest, I didn't even think the letter would reach the CEO of the company. It feels good knowing I helped, even if just a little. I graduated with an English degree but I've been jobless and discouraged after trying to study for the GRE. I've been feeling useless and hopeless, but today I felt a little more like I had purpose.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ihazk3/i_helped_my_immigrant_father_get_a_raise/,2020-08-27 00:30:16,1,2,0

I've never been one the dealt with depression or anxiety where it was debilitating my whole life. Last year, it hit me hard all at once and for a long time I didn't know how to deal with it obviously. A lot of sleepless nights and cry sessions(thanks val). I just felt like I was a different person than who I was just a few months ago. A part of me started giving up and without my support system I might of but I can happily say I've made it through the rough patch I believe. I AM HAPPY FOR ONCE :).

Physically have been having multiple problems but am working and dealing with them daily and that's okay cuz we tough out here. BUT besidez that I have dropped 16lbs in the last month with my cut and have really cleaned up my diet, shooting for 200lbs in the next month, lose all this rona weight. I stopped eating pizza weekly and Oreos daily, like I used to eat PACKS of Oreos daily. I WAS ADDICTED and I'm not no one-sleeve chump out here. 

Most importantly, I got engaged!!!! 🤑 Time to save all the dat cash money on taxes. Just kidding, am seriously super excited to get hitched with the girl of my dreams. She's my #1 swolemate always and she pretty cute tho 😜. 

TLDR just had a lot of stuff going on last year and am for the first time in months not faking being happy. So wanted to tell everyone lol, have a good day and if you made to the end, thanks for listening. 🤗

miladagi,The dark old cloud is finally gone! 🌻 I'm doing better now.,"Three months ago, I quit my job. My boss sexually harassed me for a year, manipulated me with my money, and eventually left me penniless after he decided to hold on to my paychecks to keep me around. He always reminded me that I was a nobody without him, and that no one would ever hire me. He made my self esteem crash. After I resigned, I went through a lot of traumatic flashbacks (I was sexually abused as I kid), suffered night terrors, had a million panic attacks and crying spells everyday, lost a lot of weight, and fell into depression. Got a job at a retail store where I was treated like garbage by the manager and forced myself to quit 2 weeks in because I couldn't stand being treated in such a way again. I was really at my lowest of lows for two and a half months. On top of that, my (now former) best guy friend ghosted me. Just as we were getting romantic, he cut me off with no explanation. I had no one to turn to. He didn't even know what I was going through and I was about to tell him everything. It all became too much. I have a history of suicide attempts and I was plotting another one. 

The night that I kept contemplating suicide, a friend reached out regarding the teaching position. I got the interview. Now all I needed to do was go in and show them how well suited I was for the job. That's exactly what I did. They loved me and offered me the position on the spot. They said they typically wait things out and get a feel for the person applying but that they loved my attitude and also the fact that I had some experience already. That interview was two weeks ago.
Today was my first day! It went so great! I'm so happy to be in an environment where I am respected. I don't have to worry about being touched or being verbally condescended. I cut my hair to cut memorie ties with my boss, as he loved touching my hair and I died a little inside every time. I look and I feel fantastic. I'm back to my workout and diet routine (I'm a competitor). And love is at my door. An old friend and I have reconnected the past two weeks and now we have a date! We've always liked each other but timing was off. We just randomly started talking again and this time, timing is just right. I'm taking things slow with this one because I really do want this with him. I have such a good feeling about everything. I guess tables do turn for the better.

He didn’t want me to thrive. I think deep down, he didn’t want his girlfriend to be more educated than him. I think that would’ve hurt his ego.

Waxenboss123,Dogs bruh (Heartwarming story about rescue dog and her brother),"So a while back we adopted this dog called Lexie who had spent all of her life on the streets, now this meant she was subjected to abuse from loads of people and having to savage for food. When we got her she was really scared of everyone and everything so it took a lot of work in order to make sure she adapted to her surroundings.

Now at the time we had a French Bulldog called Dave and he wasn't fond of Lexie to begin with either; and he would stay far away from her. On top of that Lexie tends to jump at even the slightest noise that's deemed to be loud and she can't sleep easily at night.

Overtime Dave eventually began to like her and he noticed how hard it was for her to sleep. So to combat this every-night he lies next to Lexie and they snore together just so that she never feels alone. Now Dave rests his head on Lexie's every night to make sure she's safe and she hasn't had a bad night's sleep since.

# How to increase serotonin in the human brain without drugs

[Simon N. Young](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Young%20SN%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=18043762)

For the last 4 decades, the question of how to manipulate the serotonergic system with drugs has been an important area of research in biological psychiatry, and this research has led to advances in the treatment of depression. Research on the association between various polymorphisms and depression supports the idea that serotonin plays a role, not only in the treatment of depression but also in susceptibility to depression and suicide. The research focus here has been on polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter, but other serotonin-related genes may also be involved.[1–5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r1-1) In the future, genetic research will make it possible to predict with increasing accuracy who is susceptible to depression. Much less attention has been given to how this information will be used for the benefit of individuals with a serotonin-related susceptibility to depression, and little evidence exists concerning strategies to prevent depression in those with such a susceptibility. Various studies have looked at early intervention in those with prodromal symptoms as well as at population strategies for preventing depression.[6–11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r6-1) Obviously, prevention is preferable to early intervention; moreover, although population strategies are important, they are ideally supplemented with preventive interventions that can be used over long periods of time in targeted individuals who do not yet exhibit even nonclinical symptoms. Clearly, pharmacologic approaches are not appropriate, and given the evidence for serotonin's role in the etiology and treatment of depression, nonpharmacologic methods of increasing serotonin are potential candidates to test for their ability to prevent depression.

Another reason for pursuing nonpharmacologic methods of increasing serotonin arises from the increasing recognition that happiness and well-being are important, both as factors protecting against mental and physical disorders and in their own right.[12–14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r12-1) Conversely, negative moods are associated with negative outcomes. For example, the negative mood hostility is a risk factor for many disorders. For the sake of brevity, hostility is discussed here mainly in relation to one of the biggest sources of mortality, coronary heart disease (CHD). A meta-analysis of 45 studies demonstrated that hostility is a risk factor for CHD and for all-cause mortality.[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r15-1) More recent research confirms this. Hostility is associated not only with the development of CHD but also with poorer survival in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r16-1) Hostility may lead to decreased social support and social isolation,[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r17-1) and low perceived social support is associated with greater mortality in those with CAD.[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r18-1) Effects are not just limited to CHD. For example, the opposite of hostility, agreeableness, was a significant protective factor against mortality in a sample of older, frail participants.[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r19-1)

The constitution of the WHO states “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r20-1) This may sound exaggerated but positive mood within the normal range is an important predictor of health and longevity. In a classic study, those in the lowest quartile for positive emotions, rated from autobiographies written at a mean age of 22 years, died on average 10 years earlier than those in the highest quartile.[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r21-1) Even taking into account possible confounders, other studies “found the same solid link between feeling good and living longer.”[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r12-1) In a series of recent studies, negative emotions were associated with increased disability due to mental and physical disorders,[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r22-1) increased incidence of depression,[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r23-1) increased suicide[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r24-1) and increased mortality[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r25-1) up to 2 decades later. Positive emotions protected against these outcomes. A recent review including meta-analyses assessed cross-sectional, longitudinal and experimental studies and concluded that happiness is associated with and precedes numerous successful outcomes.[26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r26-1) Mood may influence social behaviour, and social support is one of the most studied psychosocial factors in relation to health and disease.[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r27-1) Low social support is associated with higher levels of stress, depression, dysthymia and posttraumatic stress disorder and with increased morbidity and mortality from a host of medical illnesses.[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r27-1)

Research confirms what might be intuitively expected, that positive emotions and agreeableness foster congenial relationships with others.[28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r28-1),[29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r29-1) This in turn will create the conditions for an increase in social support.

Several studies found an association between measures related to serotonin and mood in the normal range. Lower platelet serotonin2 receptor function was associated with lower mood in one study,[30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r30-1) whereas better mood was associated with higher blood serotonin levels in another.[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r31-1) Two studies found that greater prolactin release in response to fenfluramine was associated with more positive mood.[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r32-1),[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r33-1) The idea that these associations indicate a causal association between serotonin function and mood within the normal range is consistent with a study demonstrating that, in healthy people with high trait irritability, tryptophan, relative to placebo, decreased quarrelsome behaviours, increased agreeable behaviours and improved mood.[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r34-1) Serotonin may be associated with physical health as well as mood. In otherwise healthy individuals, a low prolactin response to the serotonin-releasing drug fenfluramine was associated with the metabolic syndrome, a risk factor for heart disease,[35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r35-1) suggesting that low serotonin may predispose healthy individuals to suboptimal physical as well as mental functioning.

Nonpharmacologic methods of raising brain serotonin may not only improve mood and social functioning of healthy people — a worthwhile objective even without additional considerations — but would also make it possible to test the idea that increases in brain serotonin may help protect against the onset of various mental and physical disorders. Four strategies that are worth further investigation are discussed below.

The article by Perreau-Linck and colleagues[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r36-1) (page 430 of this issue) provides an initial lead about one possible strategy for raising brain serotonin. Using positron emission tomography, they obtained a measure of serotonin synthesis in the brains of healthy participants who underwent positive, negative and neutral mood inductions. Reported levels of happiness were positively correlated and reported levels of sadness were negatively correlated with serotonin synthesis in the right anterior cingulate cortex. The idea that alterations in thought, either self-induced or due to psychotherapy, can alter brain metabolism is not new. Numerous studies have demonstrated changes in blood flow in such circumstances. However, reports related to specific transmitters are much less common. In one recent study, meditation was reported to increase release of dopamine.[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r37-1) The study by Perreau-Linck and colleagues[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r36-1) is the first to report that self-induced changes in mood can influence serotonin synthesis. This raises the possibility that the interaction between serotonin synthesis and mood may be 2-way, with serotonin influencing mood and mood influencing serotonin. Obviously, more work is needed to answer questions in this area. For example, is the improvement in mood associated with psychotherapy accompanied by increases in serotonin synthesis? If more precise information is obtained about the mental states that increase serotonin synthesis, will this help to enhance therapy techniques?

Exposure to bright light is a second possible approach to increasing serotonin without drugs. Bright light is, of course, a standard treatment for seasonal depression, but a few studies also suggest that it is an effective treatment for nonseasonal depression[38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r38-1) and also reduces depressed mood in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder[39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r39-1) and in pregnant women suffering from depression.[40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r40-1) The evidence relating these effects to serotonin is indirect. In human postmortem brain, serotonin levels are higher in those who died in summer than in those who died in winter.[41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r41-1) A similar conclusion came from a study on healthy volunteers, in which serotonin synthesis was assessed by measurements of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the venous outflow from the brain.[42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r42-1) There was also a positive correlation between serotonin synthesis and the hours of sunlight on the day the measurements were made, independent of season. In rats, serotonin is highest during the light part of the light–dark cycle, and this state is driven by the photic cycle rather than the circadian rhythm.[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r43-1),[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r44-1) The existence of a retinoraphe tract may help explain why, in experimental animals, neuronal firing rates, *c-fos* expression and the serotonin content in the raphe nuclei are responsive to retinal light exposure.[44–48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r44-1) In humans, there is certainly an interaction between bright light and the serotonin system. The mood-lowering effect of acute tryptophan depletion in healthy women is completely blocked by carrying out the study in bright light (3000 lux) instead of dim light.[49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r49-1)

Relatively few generations ago, most of the world population was involved in agriculture and was outdoors for much of the day. This would have resulted in high levels of bright light exposure even in winter. Even on a cloudy day, the light outside can be greater than 1000 lux, a level never normally achieved indoors. In a recent study carried out at around latitude 45° N, daily exposure to light greater than 1000 lux averaged about 30 minutes in winter and only about 90 minutes in summer[50](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r50-1) among people working at least 30 hours weekly; weekends were included. In this group, summer bright light exposure was probably considerably less than the winter exposure of our agricultural ancestors. We may be living in a bright light–deprived society. A large literature that is beyond the scope of this editorial exists on the beneficial effect of bright light exposure in healthy individuals. Lamps designed for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder, which provide more lux than is ever achieved by normal indoor lighting, are readily available, although incorporating their use into a daily routine may be a challenge for some. However, other strategies, both personal and institutional, exist. “Light cafes” pioneered in Scandinavia have come to the United Kingdom,[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r51-1) and an Austrian village that receives no sunshine in the winter because of its surrounding mountains is building a series of giant mirrors to reflect sunlight into the valley.[52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r52-1) Better use of daylight in buildings is an issue that architects are increasingly aware of. Working indoors does not have to be associated with suboptimal exposure to bright light.

A third strategy that may raise brain serotonin is exercise. A comprehensive review of the relation between exercise and mood concluded that antidepressant and anxiolytic effects have been clearly demonstrated.[53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r53-1) In the United Kingdom the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which works on behalf of the National Health Service and makes recommendations on treatments according to the best available evidence, has published a guide on the treatment of depression.[54](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r54-1) The guide recommends treating mild clinical depression with various strategies, including exercise rather than antidepressants, because the risk–benefit ratio is poor for antidepressant use in patients with mild depression. Exercise improves mood in subclinical populations as well as in patients. The most consistent effect is seen when regular exercisers undertake aerobic exercise at a level with which they are familiar.[53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r53-1) However, some skepticism remains about the antidepressant effect of exercise, and the National Institute of Mental Health in the United States is currently funding a clinical trial of the antidepressant effect of exercise that is designed to overcome sources of potential bias and threats to internal and external validity that have limited previous research.[55](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r55-1)

Several lines of research suggest that exercise increases brain serotonin function in the human brain. Post and colleagues[56](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r56-1) measured biogenic amine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with depression before and after they increased their physical activity to simulate mania. Physical activity increased 5-HIAA, but it is not clear that this was due to increased serotonin turnover or to mixing of CSF from higher regions, which contain higher levels of 5-HIAA, with lumbar CSF (or to a combination of both mechanisms). Nonetheless, this finding stimulated many animal studies on the effects of exercise. For example, Chaouloff and colleagues[57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r57-1) showed that exercise increased tryptophan and 5-HIAA in rat ventricles. More recent studies using intracerebral dialysis have shown that exercise increases extracellular serotonin and 5-HIAA in various brain areas, including the hippocampus and cortex (for example, see[58–60](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r58-1)). Two different mechanisms may be involved in this effect. As reviewed by Jacobs and Fornal,[61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r61-1) motor activity increases the firing rates of serotonin neurons, and this results in increased release and synthesis of serotonin.[62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r62-1) In addition, there is an increase in the brain of the serotonin precursor tryptophan that persists after exercise.[63](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r63-1)

The largest body of work in humans looking at the effect of exercise on tryptophan availability to the brain is concerned with the hypothesis that fatigue during exercise is associated with elevated brain tryptophan and serotonin synthesis. A large body of evidence supports the idea that exercise, including exercise to fatigue, is associated with an increase in plasma tryptophan and a decrease in the plasma level of the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine and valine (see[64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r64-1),[65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r65-1) for reviews). The BCAAs inhibit tryptophan transport into the brain.[66](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r66-1) Because of the increase in plasma tryptophan and decrease in BCAA, there is a substantial increase in tryptophan availability to the brain. Tryptophan is an effective mild hypnotic,[67](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r67-1) a fact that stimulated the hypothesis that it may be involved in fatigue. A full discussion of this topic is not within the scope of this editorial; however, it is notable that several clinical trials of BCAA investigated whether it was possible to counter fatigue by lowering brain tryptophan, with results that provided little support for the hypothesis. Further, exercise results in an increase in the plasma ratio of tryptophan to the BCAAs before the onset of fatigue.[64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r64-1),[65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r65-1) The conclusion of these studies is that, in humans, a rise in precursor availability should increase serotonin synthesis during and after exercise and that this is not related to fatigue, although it may be related to improved mood. Whether motor activity increases the firing rate of serotonin neurons in humans, as in animals, is not known. However, it is clear that aerobic exercise can improve mood.

As with exposure to bright light, there has been a large change in the level of vigorous physical exercise experienced since humans were hunter-gatherers or engaged primarily in agriculture.[68](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r68-1) Lambert[68](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r68-1) argued that the decline in vigorous physical exercise and, in particular, in effort-based rewards may contribute to the high level of depression in today's society. The effect of exercise on serotonin suggests that the exercise itself, not the rewards that stem from exercise, may be important. If trials of exercise to prevent depression are successful, then prevention of depression can be added to the numerous other benefits of exercise.

The fourth factor that could play a role in raising brain serotonin is diet. According to some evidence, tryptophan, which increases brain serotonin in humans as in experimental animals,[69](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r69-1) is an effective antidepressant in mild-to-moderate depression.[67](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r67-1),[70](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r70-1) Further, in healthy people with high trait irritability, it increases agreeableness, decreases quarrelsomeness and improves mood.[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r34-1) However, whether tryptophan should be considered primarily as a drug or a dietary component is a matter of some dispute. In the United States, it is classified as a dietary component, but Canada and some European countries classify it as a drug. Treating tryptophan as a drug is reasonable because, first, there is normally no situation in which purified tryptophan is needed for dietary reasons, and second, purified tryptophan and foods containing tryptophan have different effects on brain serotonin. Although purified tryptophan increases brain serotonin, foods containing tryptophan do not.[71](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r71-1) This is because tryptophan is transported into the brain by a transport system that is active toward all the large neutral amino acids and tryptophan is the least abundant amino acid in protein. There is competition between the various amino acids for the transport system, so after the ingestion of a meal containing protein, the rise in the plasma level of the other large neutral amino acids will prevent the rise in plasma tryptophan from increasing brain tryptophan. The idea, common in popular culture, that a high-protein food such as turkey will raise brain tryptophan and serotonin is, unfortunately, false. Another popular myth that is widespread on the Internet is that bananas improve mood because of their serotonin content. Although it is true that bananas contain serotonin, it does not cross the blood–brain barrier.

α-Lactalbumin, a minor constituent of milk, is one protein that contains relatively more tryptophan than most proteins. Acute ingestion of α-lactalbumin by humans can improve mood and cognition in some circumstances, presumably owing to increased serotonin.[72](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r72-1),[73](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r73-1) Enhancing the tryptophan content of the diet chronically with α-lactalbumin is probably not practical. However, increasing the tryptophan content of the diet relative to that of the other amino acids is something that possibly occurred in the past and could occur again in the future. Kerem and colleagues[74](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r74-1) studied the tryptophan content of both wild chickpeas and the domesticated chickpeas that were bred from them in the Near East in neolithic times. The mean protein content (per mg dry seed) was similar for 73 cultivars and 15 wild varieties. In the cultivated group, however, the tryptophan content was almost twice that of the wild seeds. Interestingly, the greater part of the increase was due to an increase in the free tryptophan content (i.e., not part of the protein). In cultivated chickpeas, almost two-thirds of the tryptophan was in the free form. Kerem and colleagues[74](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r74-1) argue that there was probably selection for seeds with a higher tryptophan content. This is plausible, given another example of an early strategy to increase the available tryptophan content of an important food source. Pellagra is a disorder caused by niacin deficiency, usually owing to poverty and a diet relying heavily on corn (maize), which has a low level of niacin and its precursor tryptophan. Cultures in the Americas that relied greatly on corn used alkali during its processing (e.g., boiling the corn in lime when making tortillas). This enhanced the nutritional quality of the corn by increasing the bioavailability of both niacin and tryptophan, a practice that prevented pellagra.[75](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r75-1) The Europeans transported corn around the world but did not transport the traditional alkali-processing methods, thereby causing epidemics of pellagra in past centuries. Breeding corn with a higher tryptophan content was shown in the 1980s to prevent pellagra[76](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r76-1); presumably, it also raised brain serotonin. In a recent issue of *Nature Biotechnology*, Morris and Sands[77](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r77-1) argue that plant breeders should be focusing more on nutrition than on yield. They ask, “Could consumption of tryptophan-rich foods play a role in reducing the prevalence of depression and aggression in society?” Cross-national studies have reported a positive association between corn consumption and homicide rates[78](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r78-1) and a negative association between dietary tryptophan and suicide rates.[79](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r79-1) Although the idea behind such studies is interesting, any causal attribution must remain speculative, given the possible confounds. Nonetheless, the possibility that the mental health of a population could be improved by increasing the dietary intake of tryptophan relative to the dietary intake of other amino acids remains an interesting idea that should be explored.

The primary purpose of this editorial is to point out that pharmacologic strategies are not the only ones worthy of study when devising strategies to increase brain serotonin function. The effect of nonpharmacologic interventions on brain serotonin and the implications of increased serotonin for mood and behaviour need to be studied more. The amount of money and effort put into research on drugs that alter serotonin is very much greater than that put into non-pharmacologic methods. The magnitude of the discrepancy is probably neither in tune with the wishes of the public nor optimal for progress in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/iemcyo/how_to_increase_happiness_serotonin_in_the_human/,2020-08-22 17:16:41,1,3,0

At 6pm he picked me up from work. As a surprise he took me out to dinner, we had some Asian snacks and mojitos. We went shopping and he got me a really comfy bathrobe so I could be comfortable at home. When we got home he had bought me some of my favorite snacks as a surprise. We went for a walk and watched Netflix together and were now getting ready for bed.

bluewafflestomping,Last night my boyfriend told me I was his best friend,"We went over to his house, and he cooked for me. It's not common, but I love it when he does and it makes me feel so special. I told him as much. What he cooked was CRAZY DELISH and I gave him a play by play of how much I loved it while I ate it. 
 
  
  
We'd spent all day that day talking about potentially moving to his hometown in about a year so we can save money on rent (rent prices are much cheaper there) and go to school at a nearby university (we both want to get our masters degree; education for me, and art for him) while he reconnects with his family. We ended up talking about marriage and kids, too (hypothetically). We're both in our 30's and have been together for about a year. He's been divorced once, and I've never been married before. I really like that he cares about things like a ceremony and me wearing a dress.
  
  
  
I think the topic of whether his friends and family would like me came up (""what if your dad doesn't like me?"" ""What if your sister doesn't like me?"" ""What if your friends don't like me?"" ""What if your very very best friend doesn't like me?""). Then he says to me ""but you're my best friend"".
  
  
  
At first I kind of laughed it off, cuz isn't that what guys say to placate their clingy girlfriends? But I saw this look on his face, so I asked him if he really meant it...and he just said ""yeah, you're my best friend.""

  
  
So I said ""Well I guess we'll just have to live with your best friend hating me.""

That money could have fixed my roof, and fixed my well water so it wasn't poisonous any more--especially to my kids and my pregonate wife.

MHSTRONG,Celebrating 13 Years Of Marriage Despite Dealing With Mental Health Illnesses &amp; Setbacks," Dear All,

I want to encourage everyone in the midst of a struggle or a tough season. I've been there. I can't tell you how many days I've spent crying at my SO's bedside due to his mental health issues wrecking our relationship.

Keith and I have been together for 13 years. We have had experiences with inpatient and four intensive outpatient programs, thousand of counseling hours, medication trials, Ketamine infusions, multiple disorders, multiple job losses, two separations, a jail incident and more.  

Today, we are happily married despite living these daily struggles. It's not perfect. But it's progress. He sought treatment and I educated myself on his mental illness/conditions.

I promise, the struggle is worth it. It's not going to be easy. But it can be worth it. I told him, ""As long as you don't give up on yourself, I won't give up on you ever.""

You CAN have a successful &amp; thriving relationship despite mental illness. Stay the course, get professional help, get plugged into a support network &amp; stay educated with your SO.

Love,

Erin Ramachandran

speedynstressed,Academically successful and happy after hating highschool,"I truly hated highschool. Living in a very small town, the teachers were subpar to say the least and I had to fake liking my classmates every single day whilst feeling unhappy and lonely.

Now I've finished my first year of university. During this year I've found a group of friends I truly believe will be with me throughout my life. I study chemical engineering at the top technical university in my country and this autumn I'm starting my doublemajor with mathematics at the other top university in my country.

Candice-Lynn13,"Maybe not a typical ""happy"" post since I'm still struggling, but I'm feeling a little less hopeless than normal.","I've been in weekly therapy since November 2019 (diagnosed with depression, and anxiety 19 years ago, bipolar type 2 9 months ago, and PTSD a month ago) and today I saw that it's actually making a difference. 

I've had a lot of crazy, hurtful, and traumatic things happen the past 2-4 months, and in my last session (last Monday), I was able to point out and admit that I'm falling into a depressive episode. 

Before therapy I don't think I would have been able to recognize the signs. I would have just allowed myself to spiral deeper down and fall into my old self harm habits. But by being able to see it happening, I'm able to make a plan on how to stop it from getting worse, focus on the self-care necessary for me at this time, and most importantly I have my weekly therapy to talk about it in a safe and productive manner. 

Therapy doesn't stop the depressive episodes, but it's helping me see the ""symptoms"" a bit more clearly, and helps me feel a little less hopeless about them. 
I'm not out of the episode yet, but now I know I won't be in it forever and that it will get better. And to be able to see/say that is a huge step for me.

So I'm gonna call that a win, and definitely something to be happy about.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ib43a6/maybe_not_a_typical_happy_post_since_im_still/,2020-08-17 00:42:26,1,2,0
nicgoillamhaoil,After a rough five months I finally got a job offer!,"I (26F) have worked since I was 14. Unfortunately in March (due to current circumstances) I was let go from my post, which was awful. I had just bought a house in November ‘19. I have applied to approx 100 jobs in the past five months and had a crazy week! 
I interviewed for Job A on Monday, and Job B on Tuesday. I figured I wouldn’t hear back from Job B as I had interviewed at this firm before and was unsuccessful, so wasn’t holding my breath and marked it down to good experience if nothing else. 

Job A offered me a position on Wednesday and I could have cried with happiness! Job A is a 30-40 minute drive from me and offered a salary that would cover my bills pretty decently, but was a pay cut from my role pre-lockdown. I offered to come in to their office to fill out required paperwork (proof of address etc) on Wednesday and was told I would hear back soon with the ‘formal offer’. I did my happy dance and went home. 

Then at 4:50pm on Friday evening Job B rang and offered me not the position I had applied for but a better one with a significant raise and asked me to start next week! Not only is this a raise from the post I had applied for, it’s also a raise from the salary I was on pre-lockdown! It’s ten minutes from my house and a huge firm with a lot of potential for growth. Again, almost had happy tears.

NOTbelligerENT,I'm happy because my life is finally taking the path I always fantasized about.,"I started talking to and now officially dating a beautiful woman. I feel like I'm not gaining just a girlfriend, but I'm gaining a best friend. I've had insecurities rooted in my body and mind for my entire life. I was always, like most others, petrified of being hurt. And even though it's still possible, right now i'm 3 months in to a relationship with a beautiful girl that's way out of my league. She recently met the majority of the family who all love her, and she likes them too. 

As far as my professional life is concerned, for so long I worked at a place I didn't like. I've always been someone who loves to work hard and go the extra mile. I've always been the one to make sure my bosses look good, but I've never received any type of extra compensation or recognition due to poor leadership. Recently, I took a new job at a large ad agency downtown Chicago, and within 3 months i've already received my first promotion and bonus check. I start my new role as a leader for the first time on Monday, and I couldn't be more excited.

As far as my girlfriend goes, I think I am going to tell her I love her soon. It's about to burst out of me anyway, and I've almost already let it slip. I think she feels it too because last night she told me that she loves spending time with me, and that she treasures my heart. This is my first real relationship, so it's very scary. But overall, i've never been happier in my entire life.

Coming from some of the deepest and darkest levels someone can be at to where I am at now makes me emotional.

Thuxs,My boyfriend is the reason I can get a piano!,"Okay so this might be all over the place but I am just so happy!
I moved out of my parents place and into the second story of a tiny house with my boyfriend, now having 5 rooms(including bathroom and bedroom) instead of former 23 rooms (although shared with three other people) is a huge adjustment. I only had one room to call my own but stuff like the instruments or shelves were shared and I left a lot behind.
By knowing the room counter, you can imagine that my parents are well off. They own multiple instruments and just recently got gifted an old piano which they intended to gift me for my move. 
My boyfriend lived in this apartment for years so it's pretty full with his belongings and I didn't have space for a piano, anywhere, due to shelves and other stuff.
I talked to him that I really wanted the piano and was scared he wouldn't agree due to me already having my harp here, but he told me that he'd love to listen to me play so he'll see what he can do.
Now by arranging and selling some of his belongings he doesn't need and want anymore he actually found the space for me and I am just so so happy! 
If he wasn't so awesome I would not have been able to say yes to the piano! I am just so grateful!

ImBieksa,Reddit almost broke me; but also save me from going into dark place,"Would like to share a little story of myself with fellow Redditors.

I joined Reddit 2 years ago today. I am an introvert and I am not as creative as most people online. I was pretty much a casual user that browse posts without commenting much (almost none).

My SO is a RT (Respiratory Therapist) at local hospital and treats COVID patient everyday. It was stressful for my SO. So one day in April I decided to make a post to cheer for my SO and her team on Reddit. For whatever reason my post was downvoted like crazy within first few hours (like -50 or something) with people calling me Karma seeking and trying to get freebies because ""you are a Doctor-wannabe"" .... it was so toxic, to a point I got PM for personal attack.

Being an introvert I don't have ""courage"" to fight back online so I stayed away from Reddit. I was basically trapped at home with no sports on TV and not browsing Reddit for entertainment. Everything seems fine until mid-April when I started feeling a bit strange. My energy level was low and I can tell something is not right with my mind..

I started to browse around Reddit again in early May and I had like 50 notifications/replies from previous postings unread. I was afraid of opening those message. I was sad, feeling negative, and not feeling love at all. Until one day I saw a Reddit post about mental health issue and how to deal with Reddit.... There were tons of positive comments, support from other Redditors to OP and I followed their suggestions. One poster commented we should spread the love, focus on the love, don't let other's comment make or break your day.. I decided to PM that user and started to talk to a stranger that I've never meet. He/She was VERY helpful, we chatted for couple weeks and he/she gave me lots of advice and suggestion.

Since then I have been an active participant on Reddit. I found the beauty of Reddit. Yes Reddit could be toxic in some subs, and I finally understood being downvoted does not mean I am wrong or a bad person. I am glad that there are still many subs, users on Reddit that are spreading love around. So today is my cakeday, I have been looking forward to this day so I could share my side of story with you all.

To all strangers, thanks for reading my post. Spread the Love: It is good for you psychologically, it attracts positive things in your life, it counteracts hate.

**TL:DR** \- I was ""bullied"" by Reddit, was depressed and went to dark place. A Reddit users showed me the love and helped me get out of the dark place. Please Spread the Love around. Thank You",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/i5k0kq/reddit_almost_broke_me_but_also_save_me_from/,2020-08-07 19:11:55,1,3,0

imterriblywasted,We've left the honeymoon phase and it all feels different in the best possible way.," I realized it a few days ago when I was around a couple that is still deeply in it, watching them made me realize that I was wrong when I said that we would never outgrow it. They are adorable and so in love, it made me think back to when our relationship began and how much has changed since then.

We've been married for two years, together for four and a half. We've gone through the ups and downs of being in a relationship/being human, and I'm realizing that our relationship feels different than it used to. We've spent nearly every day together since COVID while working at home, and though I do sometimes bother him too much, we pretty much perfectly coexist. Once in a while one of us will get up and give a hug to the other, make coffee, talk for a moment, and then continue working. It feels so incredibly comfortable. I've always been comfortable with him, but there is just something deeper that I suddenly realized I have been feeling lately. It's not the sort of bored comfort that you might get when a relationship goes stale or something like that, it's cozy. It feels like cabin with a warm fireplace in the snowy mountains, or like laying in bed on a rainy Saturday morning. It's hard to explain how this feels so much different because I thought that I felt all of this before, but it has evolved to something I had no idea was even possible. I don't know if it has something to do with the fact that we are maturing, thinking about having children in a few years, saving for a house, etc...but I've never felt so loved, secure, and genuinely cared for like I do now, and I couldn't be happier.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/i5igxa/weve_left_the_honeymoon_phase_and_it_all_feels/,2020-08-07 17:50:59,1,4,0

Catezero,Had an absolutely beautiful and wholesome interaction with my colleagues husband today that made me so happy and wanted to share (sfw),"My colleague B used to sit about 10 feet away from me before we started working from home. We shared a phone line but had our own extensions so prior to covid, her husband H used to call my extension when she didnt pick up and ask if I knew where his wife was. She's literally my work mom and I love them like extra parents. They've been married for 40+ years and this is just their dynamic, not like a weird possessive thing

Today, B called me for something work related and invited me over for a socially distanced patio dinner. I asked how H was doing as I know he's immunocompromised (colon cancer) and mentioned that I missed his voice. She asked me to hold on a second and next thing I knew, H was on the line saying ""hey catezero how are you doing? Have you heard from B today?"" And I said ""oh hi H, shes not at her desk right now but let me just check"" then ""I think she's left for the day, ill leave a message for her or text her to call you"" and the two of us played along like it was before covid, just the convo we used to have when B wasn't at her desk and H needed to talk to her

My ex kicked my ass a lot. I was too ashamed to admit it to my family. One day, my sister finally saw one of many hand shaped bruises on my upper arm. I broke down and confessed that I was a victim of domestic violence and felt like I wasn’t strong enough to get out of the awful situation. My exact words were “I need an angel to save me, because one of these days he is going to finish what he starts, and kill me.” 

My sister responds by picking up her phone and saying she’s calling her friend who works for the police to get some advice for me. I’m not a religious person but it always gets me when I said I needed an angel to save me and my sister put me in the phone with Gabriel who in the Bible of course, is an angel. 

We became instant friends and he talked me through how to get away. I successfully left, and never looked back. It really did take an angel to save me.

But after a life of abuse and losing my best friend and girlfriend to suicide and overdose in a month, I got deep into using opioids when I was suicidal. This became a four year long addiction. When I was sober my mental illness brought me to my knees. Drugs were a break in that pain. 

  But I got to where I wanted to die happy so I kept trying to overdose. And the last week I used I overdosed twice. But one day my baby brother told me he couldn’t wait to watch a show with me when he’s a little older and I realized it was time to change. Since then I’ve been sober 26 months.

I met this man 6 years ago at work and we were in both horrible relationships. There was always some spark. 
I randomly text him like 4 months ago just to say “I hope you’re well” bc he was in the military and I was genuinely like I hope is doing ok! Omg he wrote back and we’ve been together since. The timeline of events have led us on a beautifully imperfect path to find each other and act on that spark and let me tell you reddit... I have never felt so special in my life! 
I feel so fulfilled and it’s even better we have a history. I know this person but I’m getting to know the transformed person but still the person I met. 


I know I know I’m in this blissful stage but I can’t believe how all this happened. Like it blows my mind how I bit the bullet and sent a random msg. He was like after all these years I’d hope you’d find me (I changed my contact info after that bad breakup) I never wanted anyone else. I’m meltinggggg

pollypocket2point0,"2 years ago, I met my very best friend online","I was never allowed to invite people over, go to their house... my father would never allow it. My mum would try to whenever my father was at work though (bless her). Because of that, I never really knew how to interact with other kids growing up, nor how to make friends. When I graduated in 2017, I lost contact with every single person I met in school, moved to the other side of the country and went to uni, where my depression hit very hard, and again, I never made a single friend, dropped out in December of 2017 because my mental health was so bad. Until July 2018, I lived completely on my own, jobless, unable to find work, and absolutely miserable.

I ended up joining a fun-loving Discord server in March 2018 where unbeknownst to me, I would meet one of the most amazing people only a few months later. She and I started DMing daily in August of 2018, and to this day, we have yet to stop. Even if it's just a ""hello"", we make sure to message, snap, or even tag each other on something on Instagram. And I look forward to her notification every day without fail. We send each other Christmas and birthday presents, we do our best to comfort each other when something is wrong. She's like the sister I never had, and that's just what we are: sisters.

I would never trade her for anything else in the world.

HopefullyImOk,Finally- A friend who cared about me beyond our first conversation.,"Sounds stupid, huh? Hahaha- In some sense I suppose it does. Although I'm grateful tonight, for the first time in a while I can say that with a smile on my face and mean it. It's no secret that I have literally zero real life friends, until today.

My family had a party on the 29th, some of my family arrived although I mostly avoided the party as It's really not my sort of thing, Instead I found myself laying down outside in the shade of a tree reading a book pretending that the party didn't exist haha. This girl approached me and being honest, I was a bit annoyed at first. All I wanted to do was read and be left alone. Despite that, she introduced herself and I returned my name as well, It was actually a cousin of mine who I had never met, she was sweet and kind. It was pretty obvious I was uncomfortable at first although despite that she made an effort to have a conversation with me- Looking back, I'm so happy she did. We chatted for hours and before she left, she had asked my number which I happily shared.

Now- I never actually expected her to call or anything, anytime I have ever meant someone I liked IRL they always seem to never contact me again for one reason or another: I had naturally assumed this would be the case here as well. Although to my shock- She called and invited me to go on a hike today. Do you know when the last time I left my home to go do stuff with a friend was? Heh, probably when I was 16. \*Hint\*, I'm 18.

I know it's really lame and something that is super minor, although I was so grateful someone cared enough to invite me along on anything let alone bother giving me a call in the first place. I'm just really happy tonight and I felt like I had to share it with the world.

I'm very practical about what I just did financially, I put down a huge down payment which I had been saving up to after paying down a lot of high-interest debt. I left a job that was causing me so much stress, and while the job I took has kind of similar amounts of stress I realize that origin is within myself instead of external and I'm in a much better situation than I was, for which I'm EXTREMELY LUCKY working in a healthcare field during this time.

clg1982,"Optimism, albeit personal optimism, on or around August 1st","Around August 1st of 2008, I graduated from the police academy. In spite of the fact that I was one of the oldest people in my class, I was not quite grown up yet. I realize this statement is cliche, but it is also true. 

Around August 1st of 2010, I attended orientation for law school. My mind raced with doubts and worries about my future and my ability. I feared that I was out of my depth and I had fooled myself into thinking that I could actually succeed at such a daunting task. You see, I was married; I owned a home; I was established in my career; and I was on the promotional track. I felt as though law school might have been a fool's errand. 

Around August 1st of 2012, I was approximately two months in to an all new challenge: being single and alone for the first time in nearly 9 years. I married my high school sweetheart. As is often the case with such relationships, ours ended swiftly and bitterly. The issue was compatibly. Well, that was one of the issues, anyway. I was scared and uncertain, and I was afraid that my best days were behind me. 

Around August 1st of 2013, I met this beautiful young woman on a blind date. I did not expect the date to go well. She did not know very much about me. She did not know that I was going through a divorce and over halfway through law school with no job prospects. Nevertheless, the date was a success and I walked away in a fog. I was surprised and a little frightened by the feelings which sprung up during this date. I bore my soul to her during this first date and she still seemed interested. If I was her in that situation, I would have ran away. I am glad that she is braver than me. 

Around August 1st of 2014, I had recently graduated from law school and I was eagerly awaiting my bar exam results. I knew that I would likely have to take it again. I worked full-time as a police officer throughout law school and I did not have the time to adequately prepare for the exam. My cohorts dedicated months to study, and I could barely set aside a few hours per week. If not for the love and support of that beautiful young woman from August of 2013, I would have collapsed under the weight of my own stress. She was my rock. 

Around August 1st of 2015, I began my career anew. The love and support I received helped me weather the hard times and kept my head on straight. I really do believe she is why I passed the bar exam (on the first try), and why I made it this far. This new position, in this new field, presented plenty of challenges. But, because of her, I knew that I could handle anything.
 
On August 1st of 2018, we purchased our first home together. Apart from a fancy hotel or two, it was the nicest place in which either of us had ever spent the night. We were living the American dream. Yet, we were unfulfilled. My beautiful wife had stopped short of her goals around the time that she met me. She settled on a practical career. She enjoyed the work but longed for more. Over the following months, we talked at length about her returning to school. She, like me in August of 2010, had been selling herself short. She doubted her ability to complete the training/education needed to become a registered nurse. I could not believe that someone so smart and capable would ever doubt her potential.

Around August 1st of 2019, my beautiful wife started taking the prerequisites for nursing school while working full-time. The first couple of months were a struggle for her because she believed failure was just around the corner. She was wrong. She succeeded time and time again. She is so capable and motivated. I am so lucky to have her in my life. 

So, now it is August 1st of 2020, and we as a people are facing troubling times. Every day the numbers get worse and the unrest grows louder. How can things get better when we live in a world where facts are a matter of political opinion? Dark days, indeed. However, I am optimismistic for the future. Hopefully a brighter tomorrow starts tomorrow. My world, my personal and happy little world, woke up this morning around 8. She and our pup, Rexy, trotted down the stairs and enjoyed breakfast while I reflected on the 1st days of August which came before and where life has brought me. I am grateful for my experiences and the love I have found. As of August 1st of 2020, my beautiful wife has finished her nursing prerequisites and is about to start clinicals; our home is becoming the envy of our neighborhood; Rexy is fat and happy; and my career is going well. I am hopeful for August 2nd, and I am excited for August 1st of 2021, and so on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/i212k1/optimism_albeit_personal_optimism_on_or_around/,2020-08-01 22:22:09,1,4,0

Anyway, we were on the phone for an hour while I taught him how to download and use an email app. And learnt that he's got no one anymore and that he has a bad knee and...had been to ""one of the parcel shops to send the harmonica back but was asked to show a code"" (he had no return label until a few minutes back!!) 

Anyway, after about 1hr 30 mins on the phone, I was able to help him get his money without him having to send the harmonica back to us. 

Brightened my evening, really! He stayed on the call for a half hour after that just aimlessly chatting away. 

Reminded me so much of a British friend I have, very similar sense of humour. Happy post, thought I should share.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/i0auvm/i_helped_an_84_year_old_man_get_a_refund_for_his/,2020-07-29 23:07:04,1,5,0

GreyishJay,I had 50 dollars in my account a few hours ago.,"In February I was in a car accident that left my unable to work up until last month. I had some savings but had used most of it to buy a house back in September of 2019. The 5ish months I was out of work ate through my savings and so I prioritized bills that HAD to be paid and those that could wait. 

Got paid on Friday everything else went to bills. Hence the $50 I had left in my account this morning. Started making dinner and habitually took a look at my checkings account. I thought for some reason my payments got kicked back. I couldn’t find anything in the statement, so I put my phone down and ignored it. Checked again later. It was a direct deposit for two weeks of unemployment I had applied for 2 months ago! 

I had truly given up hope on receiving anything because everyone else I know got there’s in a week or two for longer periods of time, and none had to go through and entire interview process and give tax documents. That extra 2400 placed me from 2-3 weeks out from being back to square one, to this Friday I’ll be back to where I was before the car accident!

Snoo36187,A short encounter w/ a customer that has changed my whole day and made me want to pursue my learning into ASL!,"I have been working at fast food for a few years now but most of the time it’s boring. You get rude customers and a couple of nice ones and then you’re done for the day. Same thing everyday. Today, we had a guy come in the lobby who has came in before when our lobby was closed and we told him countless of times our lobby was closed, and couldn’t have customers yet he did not leave and tried to talk to us but couldn’t. He had a tracheotomy and by my personal observation believe he is either deaf or hard of hearing. Then, he leaves and his brother drives to the speaker and says his brother can not speak and to give him a minute to decide. After a minute or so, drives off agitated because of him. I felt so awful for him and wished we could’ve helped him. 

Today, he walks in and I recognized him and went to take his order very eagerly. I was well aware it was going to be difficult but was up to a challenge to help him. He brought in with him a white board with it saying, “Last time I came here, it was very hard.” Then he had what he wanted to order on the white board. He also knew ASL but I only know the fingerspellings and have not went further into learning the language. At first it was hard because I was confused as to what he wanted but soon caught on and rung him up. We managed to have a small conversation about his frustration of ordering and not being able to be understood. He just had such a happy vibe throughout the whole encounter and was so patient w/ me. 

He tried asking for the price and then wrote it down and I asked for the marker to write down the price for him. I eventually got him cashed out then brought his food out and just the smile on his face made me so happy. He signed “Thank you”, and I replied back with the sign and it made him smile. I’m so glad today was a different experience for him and I made him happy as he did for me. 

It may have not been an interesting experience to anyone else but it changed my whole day, and inspired me to further on into learning into ASL if he or anyone else who are deaf or unable to speak comes in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hxif6b/a_short_encounter_w_a_customer_that_has_changed/,2020-07-25 06:55:46,2,2,0

Ra_j,My daughter's recovery is what makes me happy.,"A quick back story.

When my daughter was born she was immediately rushed to the NICU due to shallow breathing. They quickly discovered a large blood clot in her brain that was causing non-convulsive seizures. She was put on a breathing tube and rushed to a regional children’s hospital for a life saving decompressive craniotomy at 1 day old.

All doctors told us due to her trauma that my wife and I should expect severe developmental delays to an unknown extent, from motor function to speech to general learning difficulties...they said we won’t know what is affected until she misses a milestone.

This little trooper has surprised and inspired us every single day since then and is hitting every milestone they told us she wouldn’t, some earlier than expected. Here she is at 8 months pulling herself to stand in her crib.

It’s been a long, bumpy 8 months, and we still have a long road ahead with follow up surgeries planned, but if anyone can rise above, it’s my little girl...and that makes me happy!

eXiLe117x,Managing to return to the man I once was for the woman I love.,"This might be a tad long so please bear with me. Okay, so there was a recent point in my life wherein I wasn't happy with my job and I didn't know which direction I was supposed to be heading. Because of the sadness that I felt, I tried to eat my troubles away. Because of that, I got bigger. It was a very vicious cycle of me being depressed, eating for momentary happiness, realizing that I looked and felt horrible, and repeat.

I swear my life would have kept going downwards if not for my girlfriend. Even when I was really down, she did her best to cheer me up and support me. Looking back, I hate myself for not realizing sooner just how much she did for me, as well as how sad she was knowing that I changed for the worst. She did her best to hide it, but my dumb brain told me that things were fine and that I could just wallow in grief until something good happened.

Well, all that changed on a particular day. I won't be able to go into any details cause it's too personal for me to share. So let's just say I was supposed to do something for her, couldn't, and felt bad. Again, she tried to hide her sadness but I could feel it that time just by looking at her. That's when I promised that I would go back to how I once was, all so that I wouldn't have to see her veiled pained expression ever again.

I worked really hard and I can say that me and her are super happy again. She became my motivation and I'll always be grateful for her and for how she supported me, believed in me, and just being there for me.

I made something that might help others find the motivation they need to do what it is that they want/have to. Because I know how sometimes it's really difficult finding that motivation, much more when trying to use it to better one's self. Hopefully, it can help. (You don't have to click on it if you don't want to as I also hope that the story alone can help others find that motivation).

butidontwantausern,I feel like lots of the posts lately have a silver lining and even if they are meant as something positive they come off as REALLY negative," Hello everyone, I do not know if I am alone with this but I want to mention it.  
Lately there have seen a lot of posts saying stuff like ""For the first time happy in a long time"" or ""I am struggling so much, but I am happy at the moment"" or ""My life has been so bad, but I am happy at the moment"" and then explaining why their life is so bad... you get the idea. I think this is also against the sub rules, as it says ""No silver linings"". Tbh the longer I am in this sub the more depressed it makes me. I usually feel awesome all the time and reading these stories doesn't make me feel good, it makes me feel sorry for the person. It totally kills my mood and enthusiasm. As much as I am happy for these people and wish for their best, I can't help but feeling sorry for them.  
I know this is kind of a depressing post itself, but I want to see if other people feel the same. If it's fine for everyone, I guess I just need to move on from this sub in order to keep my positivity. Thank you all for reading and understanding. Also I'd like to know how you guys feel about this.

Vardalia,Happy for my wife that takes care of us! ❤️,"A few weeks ago I posted how I was very happy that my wife found a hobby that she actually enjoyed doing. Since then her cleaning motivation youtube channel has taken off and I'm very proud of her. But this post isn't about that. With 4 kids and 13 years of marriage she has done most of the chores and cleaning with very little complaining. I have helped out sometimes and so have the kids, but as a SAHM she is home longer hours than we are. Without her we would be without clean clothes and probably living in a dirty house. I a very greatful to have met her. Comment below for someone you are greatful for, and let's show some much needed appreciation that we often forget.

istoleyourcats,I am blessed with the best boyfriend I could ask for and it has made me happier than I have felt in YEARS,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to say I am new here so sorry if the formatting is a bit off or any of this is weird but I needed to get it out somewhere. 

I (20F) have been dating my boyfriend (21M) for over a year and I can easily say this is the happiest I have ever been. I wake up every day and look over at him and cannot help but get the biggest smile on my face. He is so supportive with everything I do and he helps me work towards achieving my goals and keeps me grounded when my mental health is dipping down. I could go on and on and on for days. I am really insecure about my weight but he reassures me all the time that he loves me and how I look and he likes to make sure I never forget it. Yesterday morning, I woke up to a surprise breakfast in bed of homemade breakfast burritos with all of my favorite ingredients and later on in the day when I was having really bad cramps, he went out and got me “yummy comfort food” which made me feel better. We have spent the past week watching Avatar together every night because I have never seen it all the way through, and it is honestly one of my favorite activities we have done in a while. 

I’m really not sure if these are the types of things posted here, so I am sorry if this rambling nonsense is off, but I just can’t hold it in any longer.

   Recently, she found her self feeling overwhelmed and kinda depressed with everything going on in the world and being over worked. (We both work in healthcare and have been working nonstop throughout the pandemic)

   I suggested a hobby. Seeing how she has always loved makeup, I thought she should start an Instagram page about her makeup. 
 
  She did and has slowly started posting pictures to it. She’s really enjoying herself! I was her only follower for about 6 months. Recently she gained 13 followers. She was so excited, and happy about that small gain. It was adorable!! 

So I’m here to ask you all for a favor. I love seeing my wife happy, and I would love for her to gain some more followers on her little makeup page. She deserves all the happiness in the world, and if showing off makeup makes her happy, so be it!! 

Her IG is @colormeaddicted

goestoeswoes,My boyfriend and I have just put a hold on a house to move in with one another after facing many obstacles and a LDR!!,"My boyfriend and I have been through a lot over the course of our relationship. So many ups and downs. However, we have always come back swinging. We even did long distance for quite some time. For 2 years while he was away at school and then for another year and a half while he was finishing school and I had to move away to be able to financially support myself on my own.

While I was living away I have had some issues with a potential stalker, or someone just messing with me. But living alone has been particularly hard, even though I have always lived alone. It's been scary now that I am dealing with what I am.

We weren't going to move in with each other quite yet because of the Pandemic. However, it fast tracked him to be able to work remotely. Which means we could finally move in together, meeting halfway between everything we are associated with.

This morning we just put a hold on the house that we wanted. I couldn't be more excited to move in with him. To buy his favorite scented candles. To venture with. To just be able to finally mend lives and face new obstacles with him. To get a dog! To go back to having a conventional relationship! So happy!!

I can't tell anyone in my life right now aside from my family because my job doesn't know I am leaving. And I don't want to tell them until I am ready to put in my letter of resignation.

JustBenjay,Today I learned there are better feelings in life than happiness!,"In the past years, I struggled a lot regarding different aspects of my life. One of these aspects always lingering and overshadowing the other parts was the publication of an article in my role as a phD student. Writing was utterly exhausting, and I've never imagined this whole process to become so excruciating. All the redrafts, corrections, additional data collection, debating with reviewers, dealing with my own compulsion not do any mistakes, self doubt, dependency on others, feelings of inadequacy, not being ""enough"" to fulfill the expectations of supervisors, lack of appraisal. As this whole idea evolved from an idea of a project dating back to 2015, I cannot vividly remember a longer period when this ""thing"" was not always present in the back of my mind. Especially in the beginning, I shed so many tears from everything connected to it that doubt became like a constant companion that took full control of my life when I wasn't mindful enough.


I eventually stopped imagining the moment it would actually be published, as it seemed so incredibly far away and, stretching over years, it just became ""this thing"", maybe from numbing down in the whole process.

&amp;nbsp;

Two days ago, I got the message that it was accepted for publication. 

&amp;nbsp;

I do remember that sometimes when I envisioned this moment I thought I would be incredibly floating, proud, feeling accomplished and, maybe, happy. However, what I feel right now is different. I feel ... contemplative, reflective. Grateful. Calm, somehow peaceful. Kind. Finally being able to be kinder to myself. I wouldn't describe the feeling as pride or happiness specifically. It's like my subconscious has this gentle smile directed at myself and shows me the beauty that things can come and go, but, most importantly, there is rest eventually. 


I don't think people need to survive these or similar struggles to be able to experience this wonderful feeling. But every step of the process ... getting up once more than you fall, getting help, allowing yourself to rely on others when you're in need, admitting how hard things can be ... I think all these aspects are piece by piece part of what help me actually being able to perceive this smile right now. If I could extract the most precious aspect, I would describe it as the kindness I feel towards myself right now and the gratitude that I'm able to feel it is there. In retrospect, allowing more kindness for myself along the road would have made everything seem less insurmountable. 

&amp;nbsp;

To everyone reading this, I hope you allow yourself to be kind to yourself, lenient towards what makes you worry, generous with compliments you give and take, and, most importantly, are sometimes able to give that doubt a home. At times, I felt this companion was just a voice longing to rest somewhere, too, and if I had listened more closely, it would have told me not to forget I'm just human and it's okay to be flawed.

&amp;nbsp;

I am half way through my 29 year on this specific rock and finally I can just accept myself and breath. I do not know how or when it happened one day it just was. From my experience just go easy on yourself, stop comparing your life to those around you. If you are feeling depressed or you know a spell is coming on open up to those around you let them know you need some time to yourself and more importantly accept to yourself that that is the case. There is nothing wrong  with taking time to feel better. There are people and jobs out there that will understand if you explain I promise.

clancycats,"Over the last few months, I am slowly growing aware that I am actually in love!","So, life has always been pretty tough on me, dealing with mental illness, abusive brother and my last boyfriend was just an awful person and made me feel awful. I recently had to move back home to take care of my parents, and even with COVID, I had to leave my job to protect them, especially since both have been in the hospital this year. Bet let me rewind a second, a few weeks after I moved back in October. 

I had a friend that I made while working at a grocery store back in 2013. We became great pals, shared an interest in video games, food, cocktail culture, etc. We never tried dating back then since I was dating someone else at the time. I lost my job there a few years later after my own health took a nosedive. I decided to peruse school and since there was a lot of family drama going on, a friend across the state let me move in and go to school. Several years later of living my life and having a relationship circle and finally go down the drain, I get kicked out of my ex’s, adopt a cat, and move back home. (My folks were all for the cat, so that wasn’t some sort of impulse.) 

I reconnected with my old friend (granted we texted quite often, and we would grab a drink when I was in town,) and started hanging out. After a few weeks, he asked me if I wanted to start dating him. I thought I might as well, and really enjoyed our first date, getting dinner and watching a movie. 

Several months pass, and we take our first road trip across the state together, and had a fantastic time! He got approval from my friends in that town, got to see a ton of my favorite places, and we will need to go back again for more. 

His parents really like me, getting me gifts from their trips, makes extra servings of food in case I drop by, their dog gets excited when I come by, and was an absolute doll when she met my cat! 

Now, what made me realize that I am in love, and really sets my heart a flutter; he is patient, kind, and considerate. He does what he can to lower my stress, respects when I try to tackle problems by myself, and is understanding that I have quite a bit of baggage and works around it. 

He complements me, sees us as an US and doesn’t mind helping me out financially. We plan on moving in together in a few months and knows full well that I cannot pay a cent upfront since I am not making any money while taking care of my parents. (Mom cannot move, and Dad is walking with two canes.) 

He makes sure I get away from the house every few days since it is super high stress. (Dad wants to sell the house and get himself and mom into a better living arrangement.)

He compliments me on things I never considered. He is the smartest guy I know, but he loves that I am very clever with how I have been able to survive what I have been through. He loves my determination, my kindness, my almost Disney Princess level of bonding with animals, my creativity... 

I know he wants to marry me, and have kids with me. He would like to see me go back to school if I want to, and he really wants to make sure I am happy. And these Ideas make me happily blush! Even my mom, who hasn’t met him in person, (she doesn’t like people seeing her in her current condition) can see it on my face and told me that if I love him, I need to say it often, and I do. My dad is cool with him, my niece is excited, and even my brother seems to be cool with him.

Tonight, we are having a macaroni and cheese night when he gets off work, just for fun. Gonna make my famous Pesto mac, and see if I can get some wine or a cocktail to go with it. (Would a mojito pair well? I have so much mint in my garden!)

We held a parade at our house where family and friends could drive by and say hi to the kids since we wanted to be safe and not have a party with all the covid stuff. We set up signs and a table and lawn chairs and had lots of visitors. 

An older gentleman, whom we didn’t know, stopped at our parade. Embarrassed he said “oh I’m sorry I thought this was a lemonade stand, I was going to buy a cup. Here I’ll honk my horn for your birthday.” He honked his horn and drove off. 

We thought that was sweet of him. We continued our parade party. 20 minutes pass and that same order gentleman comes back. He went to the store and bought my kids a toy for their birthday. May I remind you we do not know this man. He simply did this out of the kindness of his heart. I wish I could have gotten a name, an address, a license plate number, anything so we could thank him with some time of card.

broadturn,A happy story of an incredible stranger who became the sweetest friend,"It's a bit long but so worth the read. 

So back in 2017, my dad, sister, then girlfriend (now fiance) and I traveled to Switzerland and Austria to drop off my sister to study abroad. We made a vacation of it and while in Switzerland we ate at this gorgeous restaurant overlooking a stunning view. While checking out the view we bumped into this lady who was traveling by herself. She was from Asia and taking a vacation around Europe on her own and we just started chatting with her and got to know her. After chatting for a while, we were having such a good time that we decided to invite her to have dinner with us. We ate, drank and got to know each other for hours. 

We had such an incredible time, exchanged phone numbers and promised to keep in touch. As we were leaving, she made my then girlfriend and I promise that she would get an invitation to our wedding when we got engaged. We jokingly laughed but promised her that she would get an invitation.

The years go by, we forgot about it, my fiance and I got engaged and our wedding is now coming up in August. While we were going through our guest list, we remembered this lady and decided we were going to keep up our promise and invite her. I texted her via WhatsApp (we hadn't spoken in years and  didn't even think we would be able to get through to her) and we let her know that although we knew she wouldn't come we wanted to keep our promise and invite her.

Surprisingly, she responded! We started chatting again as if we had just met and she said that she had been meaning to take a trip to the US for a while, maybe this would be her catalyst! My fiance and I were amazed, but still had doubts that she would actually follow through.

Fast forward another few months and Coronavirus happened. Our state is doing pretty well on keeping Coronavirus down and so with some extra precautions and a slightly smaller guest list, we're deciding to proceed with our wedding. As such, I decided I would reach out to this lady again and just check to see how she was doing. 

She just got back to me. **SHE HAD BOOKED A FLIGHT AND PLANNED ON SURPRISING US!!!** This random lady that we had met on a mountain in Switzerland was sweet and thoughtful enough to fly across the world and surprise us at our wedding. I am overcome with happiness and joy at how sweet that is, and as disappointing as it is that the pandemic may not allow her to come and visit, we'll remember her and her incredible gesture forever.

The photos are of her thoughtful response and of that dinner in Switzerland. I don't know if she would appreciate her photo on the internet so her face has been blacked out for privacy.

**TLDR**: My family met a lady from Asia in Switzerland while on vacation. Got to know her, invited her to have dinner with us and became fast friends. She made us promise that my then girlfriend and I would invite her to our wedding. Years pass, get engaged, invite her to our wedding without any expectations and come to find out, she had planned on surprising us by flying from Asia to attend.

taciturntilly,I'm infertile and love my supportive friends,"Not sure if this breaks rule one, but both my friends have 3 kids all the same ages, and when they had their third babies at the same time I cant tell you how much I wished I could go through that with them, let my baby grow with theirs. But it probably won't happen, and they totally let me love their kids as though they're mine. I met them only a couple years ago and when I think of leaving them and their kids I instantly burst into tears. They accepted me, love me, support me, and if I had children I know they'd love and support me through that too. They're both amazing people and I hated where I lived until I met them. We are a great team and they make me so happy, especially once I left an incredibly toxic friendship and found them. I love them so much, one of them said ""Oh, and then after this baby uses this walker, I'll save it for taciturntilly's baby"" and I had to turn away to cry because while I don't think i will have children, I knew where her heart was and it meant a lot from her. Others may have bothered me with the comment but that she didn't? It's because I know they're trying to be entirely supportive and they love me. It will be that they must leave, it's the nature of our lives to be nomadic. But the memories they've given me and how happy I am to have these memories- I couldn't have had a better mid 20s experience, I can only hope future friendships are similar.

It unexpectedly needed repairs 6 weeks ago, due to the fault of the repair place. Thanks to the rona, some necessary parts took weeks to ship, and I wound up using a very ghetto loaner wheelchair for the 6-week wait. which caused an immense amount of anxiety, stress, pain, tears, exhaustion, and frustration for me.

internet_explored,Against all my expectations i got admitted to my dream university and major.,"Last year i finished the finnish equalent of high school and applied to some universities, but my admission test results were far off what was needed and my grades werent even nearly good enough to get me in, so i settled for something i regretted almost instantly. I forced myself to uni for a few months before finally quitting and basically didnt do anything after that for half a year. a few months ago i finally got my shit together and got a job again and applied to universities. Due to corona tho only 10% would be admitted thro admission tests and 90% with grades (normally it was 40/60). In finland you can go back to get higher grades but i got the news too late and kinda accepted i wouldn't get admitted this year either as i could't get in the year before even with much better odds. Somehow against all my expectations (mind you im quite optimistic) i managed to get good enough results and was admitted today.

I was in the other room playing with the girl I’ve been seeing’s dogs when she answered a FaceTime. She told her friend that she was with me, but that I was in the other room. I overheard her friend say “I hear you’re head over heals for this boy” and of course she starts gushing and telling her to stop. I probably had the biggest, dumbest smile on my face.

HotPinkSomething,Today I smiled genuinely after nearly 2 years of worsening depression,"I felt happy. Really.

I did not act the smile. Did not have to force it. It just came.

Woke up in super bad mood - I wanted to cancel the day - but instead

* Ate a breakfast (this is big for me!), and went to my therapist for a session
* went out to the woods for a walk, and talked with my wage mother on the phone
* Ate a lunch (also bit thing)
* Went home, urge came to crossdress, but I did not feel like it, so I did not do it (I am really anxious about my sexuality), instead I read a book about an actor's life
* On the way home, I bought groceries for my mum  
(we have been fighting for the past year, and I was holding grudges)
* Ate dinner, and played with the dod, then went out for a walk with her - watched the sky and the hills for a bit
* On the way home, I listened to some Salsa music (Elio Revé Y Su Charangón), I even sang along \*.\*  
(this is also big for me, since lately the depression took away the joy of music from me, and was slowly replacing with anxiety and unease. this was truly horrible, as before it music alway soothed my soul)
* Came home, took a shower, currently drinking some herbal tea to calm myself.

I was anxious about I not remembering how to be happy. How to feel happy.

This day has proven me wrong.

Today I felt free. Today I won a skirmish against depression and anxiety.The war is far not over yet, but hell I needed this very much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hnplb7/today_i_smiled_genuinely_after_nearly_2_years_of/,2020-07-08 21:07:14,2,3,0
Snoo_21792,Single (M45) lives in cali. Found out I have twins daughter (F2) from wild weekend with an escort acquaintance I've been with for almost 6 years when I was (36) and she's (24),"I have something to share as I've been looking for a place to post this story for a while now, this story happens at the beginning of 2020 and my life have never been the same, from just living my life day to day to actually looking forward to the next day.

Okay so where do I start. I've been living a bachelor lives here in California almost 3 years now and to say that I enjoy it is an understatement, i own a 4 bedroom house with a large backyard for gardening and for my dog (Italian Mastiff) to run around, the number of bedroom is for my family when they come visit, I also own several real estate that I have been renting out and make a decent amount of money out of it and the job that I'm currently doing pays in the ranges of mid 6 figures and I get to set my own time, I also have some stock bonds and shares from companies and businesses that I've been investing but even still I'm just doing all of this cause I can and I got nothing better to do, now don't get me wrong I love my dog and house but they are just that; some thing to pass my time with.

5 month ago before the lockdown; I got a knock on my front door at first it was weird who when I open the door I was surprised that it's this girl lets call her Jade. jade is an escort I met when I first came to the state 9 and a half year ago to pursue my Phd, I was ecstatic about the whole idea of having sex for the first time since I spent a lot of my high school and college year prepping for my field of study (Biomedical engineer) and I live most of my life in a rather conservative country in South East Asia and the fact that my family also have a very traditional (my family are of Chinese descent) approach when it comes to having relationship; which means that you only have sex with someone you want to marry even if you're a male as having a child out of wedlock (sometimes accident happens) are very frown upon, my parents have made it very clear to me that as long as I lived a single lives, sex should be the last thing on my mind.

Jade has been to me my go to escort if I just want to have sex without going to bar picking up girls I would always call her up, even as an escort she and I connect emotionally. jade and I have known each other for years before I move from Boston to Cali as I finish my Phd and got a job offer here in the west coast before we part ways we had one final sex that lasted for an entire weekend. when Jade show up she was holding 2 little girls she came up to me shaking and immediately ask if she can come in so I obliged and make her a tea to calm her, after drinking she try to reminisce about our past stating that unlike her other client I never make her fell uncomfortable and treated her badly, however as I try to catch up with her she shut me down by diverting the conversation back to stuff about what a good person I am to the point that I feel uncomfortable.

As I have a meeting in work today I told her that she can stay and make her self feel like home, I then show her the room she and the girls can use and I told her that I'll be back before 5pm, deep down I already know where these is going but I just doesn't know what to do or say. that evening I came home to a clean house and 2 cute little girl laying on the couch watching tv next to my dog and a nice smell of a home cooked meal; an authentic Chinese meal not the one you get at Chinese restaurant in the state which have been modified to please the masses outside of china and a clean kitchen, after we ate she take the girls to clean up and brush their teeth and we all actually sit down and watch TV together before she takes them to bed.

Sometimes around 8 after the girls went to bed she told me that we need to talk at first she asked me what do I think about the girls, I told her that I really like hanging out with them and before she can say anything I ask her if they are mine. she breaks down in tears telling me how this past 3 years have been a living hell for her. her parens passed away when she's 12 and she lived with her aunt ever since, that part I know about however what I didn't know is that her cousin are sexually abusive and the moment he found out that she's pregnant he's been physically abusive toward her so she fled out of fear and has been living with her fellow ex-escort friend Cammy, I know Cammy as Jade, her and I once had a threesome together.the moment she gave birth to our daughter, Cammy and her boyfriend have been asking her to go look for me and asked for child support since the two of them have been planing to move in together and start a family, and can no longer have jade living with them and since I don't have a social media presence only Linked-In also I've changed my number many times she has been trying everything to get in touch with me. as soon as they found out about my whereabouts Cammy and Her boyfriend drove her all the way from Boston to Cali with our 2 daughter.

After hearing everything that need to be said, she told me that she understand if I didn't believe her and i want a paternity test or even didn't want anything to do with my daughter as my grandfather might disown me. I shut her down and told her that I definitely want a paternity test and if they are really my daughter I will take responsibility, if not I will still support her until she can stand on her own as for my grandad situation (**he is very Traditional**), I told her that since she's half Korean (East Asian), were not in a same sex relationship and the fact that she don't do drug not even smoke, the worst he will do is give the right to the main family estate to my younger brother, which is not a big deal for me anyway since I live in the state the the main family house is in Asia.

Immediately the next three day I make an appointment for a paternity test and the following 2 weeks I got the result and they are mine, I am thrilled we then takes the girls out for some fun and as soon as we arrive home and she put the girls to bed I jumped at her and kissed her like her lips were air and I couldn't get enough of it, she looked at me in shock because the past weeks after we've been reacquainted I had been acting like I don't care. I told her that I've been acting that way to soften the blow in case the kids were not mine and it doesn't matter anyway since I'm still going to adopt them even if they are not mine. I told her how after arriving in Cali I've only had sex twice and never really liked it and for almost 3 years I have basically no sex drive at all until when she came back to me. she looks at me then tears rolls down her eye she, say she loved me and I told her I've loved her since before I moved to Cali and have actually Been contemplating to ask her to move with me but I don't have the guts to do so since I don't know how she feels, we continue to kiss and that night I had the best sex I've ever have in my entire life.

I call my dad the next day and told him everything. I was expecting to get yelled at for starting a family with a prostitute but all my dad ask is that is she still an escort or have she quit her job, I told him she wants to be a stay at home mom, and she agreed to sing a prenup as money is not really a big deal for her and we just want to spend the rest of our lives together. my mom then asked me if I'm happy, I told her yes. they have been having a FaceTime meeting with my fiancé (that's right I propose, we will Get married after the pandemic dies down, and she would love to have a traditional Chinese wedding at my hometown), and they love her, they spend the entire afternoon talking about how they think I was gay since I never been in a serious relationship with girls despite being the oldest, while all my other siblings are married at the age of 26 and have at least 2 kids after getting a stable job and are actually glad that I found someone and my parent's cannot wait to meet their granddaughter and as my other siblings as well, our daughters was habit overwhelmed as well after meeting everyone since only know of her mom as their family and now they have this huge family that really loves them an can't wait to meet them. my granddad have asked after looking at my fiancé if she's white, I told him she's mixed of Korean-American and she was born here, after a moment of silence he just nods in approval.

Now five months of living together I have never been happier, I have 2 very beautiful, wonderful and smart daughter, an amazing sex life with a wife who loves everything about me and are very eager to learn about my culture and a baby on the way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hnkkjf/single_m45_lives_in_cali_found_out_i_have_twins/,2020-07-08 16:48:31,4,9,0

IridiumTrigger,"I Just Realized How True An Old Piece of Life Advice I Got, Really Is.","A really long time ago, someone told me not to be afraid to take risks and be vulnerable, because that is what you need to do to make happy memories and get somewhere in life. It always made sense to me, but I just realized something that highlighted how true it is.

I started dating my very first girlfriend my junior year of high school, she was a senior. She was actually my sister's good friend, and when my sister went off to college we started talking, and soon after I asked her out. I think I knew even at the time that the odds were completely against this relationship. She was the number 1 student in her class, destined for Ivy League. I had another year at school left, and we would likely (if we stayed together a whole year) be doomed to a 4 year long distance relationship if we tried to make it work.

I went with my heart, and we were madly in love for the next year, but of course it ended after she went away. We only lasted about 4 months long distance, and I agonized about it for the last month. I ended up breaking up with her, but we both knew it was coming. I think I narrowly beat her to the punch. It broke my heart and hers, and at the time I regretted ever letting myself fall in love.

11 years later, and I just thought about her for the first time in God knows how long, maybe months, or years. I realized my perspective is totally changed. I don't remember what the pain felt like. I don't remember missing her, and I certainly don't miss her now. I don't feel the echo of a hole that was left in my life all those year ago, all those relationships ago.

The only thing I can really remember is the enormous love I felt for her. How sweet and cute she was. Our first kiss, her laying her head on my shoulder or my chest. Laughing until we couldn't breathe (I have no idea about what).The joy I felt sneaking out to meet her, and laying in a field under the stars all night talking about everything we wanted to do, and all the places we wanted to go together, planning trips that we only went on in our imaginations. It was pure and uncomplicated, I haven't spoken to her in probably 10 years, I have no idea where she lives, what she does, what her life is, but she is still a part of me and it's a good part.

Just wanted to share.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hnjjts/i_just_realized_how_true_an_old_piece_of_life/,2020-07-08 15:54:19,2,2,0

Rosy-Ass-of-Dawn,I had a birthday party for the first time in over five years.,"First off, it was very small and only with members of my immediate family so there was no increased risk of COVID for anyone. 

I've struggled with my mental health since my teens, and have isolated myself pretty extensively for about ten years now. My mother died five years ago, and that just made things worse. I've pushed people away, and basically thought that no one wanted me around or even liked me. Last night though, I came home and my sister, aunt, and uncle had decorated our house and bought a cake for my birthday.

It's the first real acknowledgment I've had of my birthday since my mother died, and it felt so nice to be remembered and to feel like I was actually wanted. It's really given me a new perspective on things. It made me realize that even though I've locked myself away in my mind and convinced myself that I'm alone, I *do* matter to other people and they want me to be happy. I'm going to do my best to remember that and work towards improving my mental health.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hmov6h/i_had_a_birthday_party_for_the_first_time_in_over/,2020-07-07 05:55:09,2,4,0

AdequateHusband,"My wifey has purchased an amazing gift for my 40th next month, she doesn't know I know and I'm stunned with the thought and effort she has put in.","Earlier today the postman knocked on the door. Wifey was on the phone so I took the parcel.

In those two seconds I noted it has my wifey's name on and the parcel had tell tale pictures and information on the box to know it is a piece of hobby equipment I have wanted for a few years but have never been able to justify getting.

She's patiently listened to me chat about it from time to time and I always talk myself out of getting one as I can't justify the triple figure cost for my hobby.

In that brief moment, I heard my daughter shout out as the dog accidentally knocked her over when she rushed past to greet the postman.

I took advantage of that to quickly drop it down, say thanks to the postman, rush away and comfort our daughter who was not really hurt at all.

Wifey finished her call and shouted upstairs if all was well. I said our daughter had a bump and shouted back ""she got knocked down by the dog so I'm checking she is okay. Can you sort the parcel? I just had to throw it down and run up here.""

I peaked from upstairs, saw her pick it up, sigh with relief, smile, wrap it up in a bag and take it away to hide it.

She shouted back that it was a seat cover for the garden chair and I've been happily appreciating her since. She never makes a big birthday fuss and usually forgets so I'm so incredibly touched. I won't need to practice being happy and surprised in a month as I'm so excited.

I'm really happy that circumstances meant I could cover up that I found out.

I dropped a ""we need to step back from ordering house stuff, we're getting too many parcels"" an hour or so later and she half smiled before saying she'll try and cut down with a sparkle in her eye.

Gumbo72,After 5 years battling through pain I reached 154 lbs again,"So, since I was a kid I've been battling a very strong stomach pain with no known diagnosis.

During these years I dropped from 82kg (180lbs) to 57kg (125lbs) @ 6ft in like 2 weeks and have since unable to maintain my weight over 64kg (141lbs), any time I gained a couple of lbs, pushing through the pain for a couple months, I lost them and more in a week of not being able to push myself.

I had one of these bouts at the beginning of this year, and have been since trying to push myself as much as possible as hard as it is, being able to increase several pounds my maintenance weight.

sunshadowsburn,A simple wish granted: peace; or Everything Will Be Okay,"I do need to preface this with a word about the challenges I was facing. Mental and physical health and a bad environment, and it is still a process to heal. But that is not the point of the story.

My two best friends are inside my apartment. One who I love more than anything in every possible way, sleeping, safe and happy after a long drive to see me. The other, playing her favorite game, relaxing after a long day, who I love just as much, but not in the same way.

I was not ready for sleep, so I made a bowl of ramen, went to my driveway and sat on my old desk that is waiting to find a new home, and let the moonlight infuse every pore and cell of me with peace. I turned on music that sounds like night and faeries, but the kind that slip past you as you doze away, putting your meds in a slightly more visible place and pulling your covers over your bare shoulder as you are leaving the waking realm.

Sitting here, with my ramen and the moon and the stars and my music, I felt like I had entered a life that could only be the 3 am animal crossing experience in our world. That sense that everything was right - that though the world is big and scary and painful right now, that it will turn out alright... That something, if not someone, is looking out for us, wants us to succeed 

I realized that the crises of faith I had been having - I had time to work those out at my own pace. And really, if my gods and goddess existed and I turned away from them, they would love me no matter what and still send what guidance they could. And if they didn't exist and I chose to believe in them, to make them real for me, the universe would give to me what it could.

But most of all, I realized that for the first time in many years, I was safe, secure, and happy all at once. That even if I knew the aftertaste when it passed would be bittersweet it would come again. That I could love myself, that people loved me, that I could be my authentic self and that I was a good person and could even be an extraordinary one. That I was secure, that I was safe, that I was happy; all at once. 

It's a lot to process, to be sure. But maybe that's why I knew I needed the moonlight - to remind myself to be soft and gentle and kind, to provide myself with rest after a long day of being a sun, I could be a moon to the world that is me.

Everything will be okay.

StickBush,My brother and I started to go on walks at night and they make me happy.,"We don’t go out too late but late enough that it’s nighttime kinda dark so like 7 - 8pm.

We talk about random things when we’re outside at night, I like talking about things that don’t really matter because they make life feel so simple and fun. We can make jokes so easily without thinking, the ones that take years to forget. 

Another thing I like about it is how free you feel when you look up at the stars in the sky and think about how small you are. But you never think too much about it otherwise it gets a bit depressing… you just keep on talking about nice and simple stuff. It’s kind of windy at night, no people around so it also reminds me of the feeling of camping, being away from others.

Eventually we got all of our ingredients assembled, and my god the smell was terrible. One sip was plenty for each of us. It was bad. Anyway, I thought I’d share this because it made me happy.

420thrwawayy,I have met someone amazing after being single for 4 years,"Now I know 4 years isn’t that long for some people, and I’ve had multiple short 1-3 month “relationships” during that time. I’ve been patiently searching for the man for me. I don’t believe in “the one” but I want someone compatible with me that I’m attracted to. I want to be smart about who I date because I want the best chance for my next serious relationship to succeed.

I met him a month ago off a dating app. I wasn’t expecting much, it was just another date to me. First dates have become tedious honestly. I ended up enjoying our first dates together though. Every time I see him, I become more and more into him. Superficially he’s very attractive to me and definitely my type. He works out which is great because I like to work out too. He’s intelligent (an engineer). He’s only been in the U.S. for 3 years (he’s from another country) and his English is really good already. We rarely have problems communicating to the point where I forget sometimes that he’s not actually American despite his accent. He’s ambitious. We have a similar sense of humor. We can openly talk about personal things about ourselves. We can talk about almost anything. We can just walk around somewhere or be sitting around and have something to talk about. He’s actually interested in the things I say no matter how random. And I’m interested in the things he has to tell me. His viewpoints on interpersonal and romantic relationships is similar to mine. He agrees that communication is important (this is so important to me). And he has been just so sweet and gentlemanly to me. He cooks for me, gives me massages, opens doors for me, always makes sure I’m not hungry or thirsty, etc. I of course return the favor whenever I can. He’s the perfect balance of being attentive and caring towards me but also being independent (he’s not clingy).

Some of the most impressive things he’s done are how he has dealt with my unexpected health issues. I’ve been unable to wear makeup with him a few times due to an allergic reaction. I even showed up to a date once with swollen eyelids and rashes around my eyes. I looked terrible but he was very sweet and told me it wasn’t that bad. He tells me I look great without makeup. And we’ve only been dating for a month! I don’t usually get so comfortable with my bare face this early on. He makes me feel safe when I’m with him. Once of my exes was judgmental about how I looked so I know what it’s like to date someone who doesn’t make you feel comfortable in your own skin.

Another time, I was having severe pain and he held his hand on me to comfort me for the entire 30min while driving me home and kept looking over at me to make sure I was ok. It was embarrassing for me to have to show him this side of me but it really showed me how caring he is. He even texted me later after dropping me off to ask if I was ok.

He’s always down to do whatever I suggest. I surprised him with an escape room date and he loved it. I’ve suggested different date ideas and he’s always willing to try them out with me and makes them super fun. I’ve dated guys before who would scoff at and shoot down certain date ideas so this is very refreshing.

To be honest, I can’t see anything wrong with him. I know it’s been a month so I’m just barely touching the surface of him and of our relationship. I just can’t wait to get to know him more and I’m so happy to have met him. It’s the early stages and I’m trying to be realistic that the relationship could not be what I’ve hoped for and could very well end. It’s going well so far though and I’m optimistic!

Musician_Moneyless,I Have Officially Been Diagnosed with ADHD,"I know this doesn't sound like I typically happy things but hear me out. I am overjoyed!

For years I have felt like I was different from everyone else. I just accepted my role as the weird kid and moved on with life. For my entire high school career, I got good grades, kept good friends, and achieved better than most people, but for some reason, I felt like I was in a fog the whole time. Like I wasn't connecting with myself, I spent more time in a daydream than in reality. My memory was poor in some cases, in others I remembered every detail of a pointless subject. I would feel no emotion in important situations and become over-emotional at little things. I procrastinated way worse than anyone else I knew, even on things that I wanted to do. I seemed to think on a different wavelength from everyone else. Not necessarily in a bad way, but I solved problems differently. I was just different from everyone, in good ways and bad ways.

Eventually, I started to read up on different mental disorders, mostly out of curiosity. I found out that the things that I felt that I thought were normal parts of growing up, (the daydreaming, the foggy head, the memory problems) were signs of mental illness. I was pretty sure I had ADHD, but never got an official diagnosis. Most people just assumed I was saying it to try to be edgy, like how some kids will say they're ""basically a sociopath"" just to look cool. For the most part, I just assumed they were right. I thought that I was probably just weird, lazy, and apathetic.

After twenty-one years of dealing with the symptoms, I got frustrated that no matter what I did I couldn't seem to fix the negative parts of my ""odd"" personality. I finally went to a psychologist. It took my psychologist all of two and a half sessions to administer the test and diagnose me with ADHD. I am overjoyed. I'm not just being lazy or being weird. I have an actual brain difference that makes me different from most people. I finally have someone who is helping me learn how to get rid of the negative parts of my disorder and embrace the positive parts. Once you get a handle on the apathy, procrastination, and distraction, it leaves behind the good stuff. The creativity, the generosity, the wittiness, the inability to think inside the box, and the sense of humor is left behind to shine through. You never hear about those good parts about ADHD but almost everyone who has the disorder has those things too, it's part of the brain difference.

I've known for a long time that I have those positive things, but they always got overshadowed by the fact that I could never seem to do anything with them. It has taken one therapy session and one book for me to already see a dramatic improvement in my life. Do you know how simple it is to get some people with ADHD to focus? My therapist suggested trying to draw a square with one hand and a circle with the other at the same time. It works. It fucking works! Only for a short time, but it works! Exercising vigorously helps. Things that I haven't tried yet but show promise in clinical settings are things like eating blueberries and taking fish oil supplements. It can be that easy!

It's only been a few days but the little changes are working! In the amount of time it would normally take me to just eat breakfast (sometimes as much as 4 hours because of staring into space or walking back and forth aimlessly) I managed to work out, shower, eat breakfast, clean up breakfast, and finish my schoolwork. I know it won't be all ups and no downs, but I'm just overjoyed to have a diagnosis! I finally know what's been happening to me for my entire life! I am so grateful that my personal experience with this disorder is finally on the positive side. I can finally make all the good ideas I have come to reality! No more living in my head all the time and never finishing anything!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hh1edc/i_have_officially_been_diagnosed_with_adhd/,2020-06-27 20:59:42,5,17,0

I got surprised as to how someone can be that happy (since i'm kind of a pessimist sometimes) so I pinned her video for a moment and she had the same smile even when she wasn't talking. Idk why but it felt so good seeing her smile like that. It's almost like some of her joy rubbed off on me :),https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hg4mcj/a_surprising_feelgood_moment_during_a_regular/,2020-06-26 09:48:41,1,2,0

This is a major step for me because ever sense I was a kid I’ve wanted to be a professor. These past few years I have had deaths in the family, relationships end, and jobs lost. I’ve lived on ramen and rice for over a year while sleeping in my car. But today I can say I am taking that first step.

To be honest there isn’t anyone in my personal life right now that I care to celebrate with. So I with to just have this little “HORRAY!” with you all.

itsaculturalthing,Got accepted into a Tertiary Preparation Program so I can start the process of going to University,"I didn't know where to post this but I just wanted to share this.

So I (28m) just got accepted into doing a tertiary preparation program (TPP) and I'm pretty excited to start a new chapter in my life.

A bit of a back story on myself, I quit highschool when I was in year 10 and decided to start working full-time as I thought school wasn't for me. I did 3 years of an apprenticeship but never finished it and then when I was 18 I moved out of home and started working on drilling rigs (absolutely love working on the rigs been working on them for 10 years, but I don't want to end up being 60 years old, burnt out and nihilistic like some of the company men I've worked with).

In that time I got married and then fell victim to the oilfield when it comes to relationships and ended up getting divorced at 26, then just kind of floated in the patch working and living my life with no real direction. Spending my hard earned money on frivolous things, getting drunk, doing drugs, partying etc. Then covid happened, I lost my job and have kind of just been floating again no real direction.

Until last week I got a phone call from my mum (love her) and she said she has been thinking a lot about me and thinks I should go to uni and gain some more direction in life and put my ""brain"" to good use. I've spoken with her before about it but was always hesitant due to finances after loosing my job. She then went out and did all the research she could and found out that there is this (TPP) that is absolutely free and with the right grades can get automatic acceptance into the course of my choice through said uni (Australia has its perks I guess). Anyway I did a bit of research after her initial information hunt and applied for the TPP.

I checked my emails today and discovered that they accepted my application and am now enrolled into the program. Although this is way out of my comfort zone I'm actually really excited and happy that not only can I move toward making one of my dreams come true but also happy that my mother gave me this push and believes in me so much.

Tl:Dr Got accepted to start a Tertiary Preparation Program so I can eventually go to University, have a mother that believes in me and am looking forward to starting a new chapter in my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hfgwiq/got_accepted_into_a_tertiary_preparation_program/,2020-06-25 06:09:57,1,2,0
SeokjminMatcha,"After taking care of myself during lockdown and taking crucial time out to fix my burnout, I have fallen in love with him once again.","I haven't seen my boyfriend in 3 months due to the UK lockdown and I have missed him so much. We live around a 20 minute drive away from each other, but we're only 17 and can't drive yet. Today was my birthday and he visited me in my garden, social distancing and all.

We talked for ages and there was this point where we were standing outside my house, our parents were talking. I hadn't felt like this in a long time. The evening sun was shining on his skin, he was smiling and I was just so drawn to him. He was so attractive, but sort of in multiple dimensions. I just wanted to be with him. It felt like time had stopped and at that moment I felt something. It was this spark that was missing for the past 3 months. The one you don't experience on a video call.

I realised I had fallen in love with him once again. He is a keeper.

AndreilLimbo,"Yesterday, after 4 months of failure, I finally made my first 10 dollars through internet and I felt extremely happy that I needed to tell someone."," I have tried almost everything on the internet the last 4 months. I have tried every way that these ""x ways to make money online"" sites say, but my English level is not that good, so I am currently trying to improve it, but it's still a huge burden and also I haven't studied a specialty that allows me to work only through internet. Anyway, I recently discovered the [r/slavelabour](https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/). It has all sorts of tasks for low prices no matter how weird they are. So, I have many international friends and I like studying cultures and history as a hobby, also we like mocking each other's nation and culture all the time. So the idea came and I posted ""I will make jokes about every nation you ask me, 1$ per joke"". So a guy asked me for five. Before I reply to him, I checked his profile and he was Texan, so I started reading Texan history and stereotypes for an hour, and I came out with 5 jokes about US, 3 of them included Texas. But he eventually wanted Mexico. Due to the fact that I used to study Spanish, it wasn't that hard. I also checked some history of Mexico and I quickly came out with 5(I kind of cheated though, because I made one about Colombian stereotypes, but that's a secret). He liked them so much that he also gave me 5 dollars tip. I know that it's not much, but it was a really important small step forward. I have been in plenty of jobs, but I have never been so happy for earning so little money. It was a small sparkle of light in the darkness of my desperation.

We must learn how to desire what we have and come to terms with what we do not have in order to find stability and happiness, the Dalai Lama wrote in his book The Art of Achieving Happiness.

My capstone is a two-sequence course. I just finished the first part. In order to go on to the second part, the actual capstone project, needs approval from my professor. I need this to graduate. 

To get the approval I needed to submit a prospectus outlining my research topic, my primary sources, what I though my thesis may be, etc. 15 pages without the annotated bibliography. I hate annotated bibliographies. 

I really put the work in this time. I passed the class with a B+. Today I got an email from my school saying that approval to enroll into my capstone was pending. Then I got an email from my professor saying congratulations. You are in.

I love him dearly but I had to work so hard at it. I was never enough, when I dissect it he never really loved me, he needed a distraction and from the beginning he had one foot out the door. He was also going through some difficult things and having me around made his life easier and more difficult at the same time. My relationship with my son has been so incredibly downright ugly for the same period of time. It is completely broken and very difficult which puts huge strain on all aspects of my life. A strain and pressure that I was never able to share. In the last year, between trying to hang on to a love which came along at the wrong time and my son who I was losing everyday, I had become so bitter. So full of hate and anger but most of all I had lost all hope. Today I had such an eye opening conversation with someone that it all clicked. It was my birthday recently and I received so many wishes from people reminding me that I was the funnest, most spontaneous, caring person they knew. How they've loved talking to me and how I have always been able to help them out in their darkest days. I had forgotten how to be me this past year. I had let the panic of trying to hang on to my relationship with my SO and my son completely take over me. Now. I'm not professing to be cured.

Over a year ago one of my best friends (who already owns his families restaurant) decided we wanted to go in together on a restaurant together. With him already being in the business and me wanting to get in the business we set out to make it happen. We had a plan to start small with a catering contract through a large local company where we would prepare daily meals for there meetings but when Covid hit that plan came to a screeching halt due to them switching to work from home. Shortly after that the opportunity to buy a place owned by a friend of both of our families came up. We jokingly said hey let’s buy it then soon realized we actually could. Over the past six months we worked on making the deal happen and after working secretly to do so in our spare time it has finally happened. The down payment has been made and the switch over will start in just a few short weeks.

Bad relationship was ended. A toxic friendship was ended. Distanced myself from toxic family dynamic. Spent time working on new hobbies and returning to old ones that I had given up on. Adopted my first cat, who probably saved my life from the loneliness I had been feeling from break up. Met my current partner. Moved away from a city I hated living in to live in my dream city. Partner moved down a couple months later to be with me. Made a great group of friends. Switched career paths. Got 2nd cat (kitten at the time). Got accepted into grad school. Made more friends. Helped my partner get some side gigs doing what he wants to do in life because of my networks.  Reconnected with a friend who I had disconnected with while depressed (different from friend mentioned above). Bought a house. ❤️❤️❤️

There's still some things I need to work on, like career... Because I don't really have one and I'm just working an Americorps position that will end in a few months.

3 years after separation (filed for divorce but she refused to sign the papers, the judge threw out the divorce, now she has to re-file). She's since had a child with a deadbeat who's in prison now apparently. Have a beautiful son (with her), 8 years old in October.

Got an assault charge for getting into a fight at a skate park, put on probation (I did my time and have learned my lesson, had a lot of anger in my life after the separation, not making excuses but that's the only thing I can say that would mildly explain my actions)

Re-built my credit and finally have my own apartment where I can raise my son (after staying with family and most recently a motel for 6 months).

Got my teeth fixed!

I will be celebrating 5 years at my job next month (longest I've held a job at one company, have been employed since 15 though).

Things are looking up, just have to keep at it! Thought I'd share since I don't do social media (aside from Reddit) and I don't open up to anyone really, but yeah I'm genuinely content with my situation as of now.

john-schwartz321,"If you want to be happy, first you must find true friends"," 

“Happiness only real when shared”. That’s what Christopher McCandless wrote before his death in the Alaskan wilderness aged 24. He died of starvation, alone.

Research shows that having good, true friends is the no.1 factor in determining your happiness.

Science tells us friendships are fundamental to your mental wellbeing. Strong, meaningful friendships relieve stress, provide comfort and joy, and prevent loneliness and isolation.

They’re essential for your physical health too. Studies suggest a lack of social connection may pose as much risk as smoking, drinking too much, or leading a sedentary lifestyle.

So, while many people think bagging their dream job, making good money or moving to their favourite city is the answer to finding happiness, there is a LOT of truth to Christopher McCandless’ famous quote – humans need good friends to be happy. Period.

But more than 1 in 5 millennials say they have “no friends” and over 9 million people in the UK say that they are lonely.

This *needs* addressing.

I truly believe *everyone* is capable of making meaningful friendships if they look in the right places and approach it in the right way.

Here’s some good advice on how to make good, true friends…

**1) Take the initiative**. When it comes to finding a true friend, you have to put the work in. A real friend won't just magically materialize on your doorstep, so you need to be willing to make the effort.

**2) Meet new people**

* One of the easiest ways to meet people is through friends you already have. Tag along to a party or social event and get your friend to make the introductions.
* Join clubs or classes. Friends are generally people that you share a common interest with, so the people you meet through hobbies or classes are great potential friend material.
* Meet people at work. If you have a work colleague you feel a connection with, now’s the time to invite them for a drink or bite to eat after work!
* Meet people online. There’s a little bit of a stigma attached to meeting people online, but it can be an easy way to meet cool people. Posting on online forums, DM Instagram accounts you resonate with, or try a friendship app: [Serendip](https://serendip.co/) is great for anyone aged 18-35, or [Bumble BFF](https://bumble.com/en/bff) is a good alternative.

**3) Keep an open mind.** Even if you meet someone who doesn’t *look* like the kinda person you'd have lots in common with, try chatting to them and give them a chance. They may turn out to be your closest friend!

**4) Stay in touch.** Be sure to get contact info for the people you meet - whether it's their mobile phone number or a link to their social media pages. Stay connected and show that you're thinking of them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/h7jwx0/if_you_want_to_be_happy_first_you_must_find_true/,2020-06-12 12:36:53,3,1,0

blakeyishere,A back story of how I met her: 9 months with my girlfriend addition,"Most of yall here have probably seen a post about two girls who have been together for 9 months and are the happiest ever.

Well, I am the redhead there just so yall know what it'll be about.

It has been 9 months of a journey with my girlfriend. We have been through a lot in the time.
I'm not ashamed to say, I have some deep burried issues which in a way of its own fairly affected our relationship a few times.

But even so after 9 months, I cannot imagine living without her. She makes my life so much better and she truly brings out the best in me.

After she posted her own post here at r/happy
I decided to give a little backstory.

We met about a year ago. First time, didn't talk at all what so ever. She was fairly shy and I was not really sure that she wants me to be around when I introduced myself first.

It took a while, the 2nd time we were at the same facility the same time she was way more open and talkative.

That made me realise that I have already fallen for her. It was around 4 weeks of our friendship developing. We all watched moves and played games (There was 10 of us) and overall it was some of the nicest moments of 2019 which was one of the years that has held me down a lot.

Fast forward, its the evening before I am leaving the place, 3rd October 2019, I take in all my courage to ask her out. We were alone outside in the space where through the day the others gathered and we'd smoke and talk. I light one up, mainly to have a reason to get her to stay there a while.

We talk random things a lot, and I ask her about who she liked if anyone, when she came here 2nd time. I start from a person to a person and she tells me about it. I'm the only one left.

My anxiety was building up, but I asked her ""What about me"" she said that she was thinking about it, but wouldn't be the first to ask really. Something along those lines. So I immediately asked her, and to my most utter surprise she said yes. I can't describe how happy I was.

Fast forward a few months. We were already as close as we could possibly be. And now, 9 months after we are that genuine and overjoyed couple and I cannot imagine my life without her. She is my whole world.

I have a lot of self esteem issues, but when I am with her I have a feeling like I am worth something. She's truly amazing and makes my life more enjoyable.

Thats all for today, hope you've enjoyed this short part of how we came to be.

truthinburritos,I finally got a great job after a year of searching and countless rejections!,"I graduated college in June 2019, and started job-hunting. After a full year (minus a few days), yesterday I finally received a full-time offer from my dream company!

So this is an update on my previous post.

My grandmother had her 95th birthday yesterday, and I left giving her all your cards today as I believe most of the cards have arrived now.

I know theres likely some still to come in the post, which ofcourse she will enjoy just the same! 

She absolutely loves seeing all these cards, I read each one individually out to her and showed her. 
 I did get many stories about places that you live in that she had visited! 

She wanted to thank you all so much for making an old lady feel so young and special during her birthday. She was so pleased that you all bothered to write to an old stranger! 

If anyone included their return address, I will write back to you thanking you individually. 

There was so many, I wont be able to write a reddit message back to you, so please thank you so much

bob_stacko,I just fell in love with myself for the first time. I’m 43. This is awesome!,"I grew up as an only child in a home without love or intimacy. In fact I experienced the opposite. If I had to pick one word to describe my childhood I’d pick “fighting“. I don’t remember many specific events from childhood. I mostly remember places and people, But there are a few fights between my parents that I remember well.

My dream has always been having a true life partner. I’ve had half a dozen or so relationships. One of them, the 2nd one, would’ve been exactly what I wanted had I not pushed her away out of fear. She was the only one that I initiated the break up with. All of the others broke up with me. Most of them cheated on me. The last relationship was the hardest. As I unraveled each of her lies it became clear that I was partially at fault for what happened. I realized that she treated me poorly because I let her do it. 

I’ve been out of that relationship for 2.5 months. Every day since leaving has been better that the day before it. My entire outlook on life is changing. I’m starting to see opportunity and abundance everywhere. Over the past few days I’ve realized that I am an awesome person. I’m kind, I’m funny, I’m curious, I’m intelligent, and I can handle any problem that comes my way. I am my own true life partner. I love myself.

He knows himself. He can talk about his feelings. He can talk about his family and what hurt growing up and how all the bullshit he’s gone through and how it can still affect him so that we can navigate it together and without it affecting us. 

He listens to me. He doesn’t judge me. He makes me feel safe and comfortable, but he gives me space when I need it. I’m not used to that. I’m so glad I get to share this experience with him.

Multiple things were going on...some good, some scary but taking control of my life felt great.
I was merely planning my summer and thinking of Pride.
For about a year I had developed some feels for this very close female friend of mine that I had dated over 30 years ago for just over a year.  We stayed close friends for many years.
Anyway, I had made some plans with her 5 years ago to hang out at Pride which we always did at some point but also to take her up on her offer of a couple of day trips so if that's all that would have happened it still would have been great.
Later that month I couldn't take it anymore and I simply held her hand at some point during Pride then a week later I asked her out.   We dated a year, got engaged and we have been married almost 3 years.
I am the happiest I have ever been!
It is absolutely amazing and I never would have thought that flipping the calendar yesterday would invoke all the memories of the last 5 years.

FenceNinja,I've finally found the love of my life despite all the odds,"It has been almost 6 months since our first date, and it seems so crazy to me that a love this strong could have blossomed against every bit of adversity thrown our way during this time - living hours apart, illnesses, COVID-19 social distancing, losing a loved one, job hunting, depression, etc. Despite it all, we fell **madly in love** and express it to each other freely and openly! 

He's 'my person' and there's nobody else I'd rather be with. Just the thought of how much I love him makes me tear up, plus the feeling goes both ways! We can't even go on ""real dates"", but we still have so much fun just playing games, going on aimless walks, or baking something together. We have literally only been ""out"" two-ish  times in our entire relationship, but it doesn't matter at all because we enjoy each other's company so much! 

I never thought that, at 30 years old, I'd find someone who gives me butterflies and makes me blush like a lovestruck teenager. I love everything about him - he's handsome, intelligent, accomplished, funny, loving, modest, passionate, but not only that - we share the same set of values / life goals, have similar interests, and have crazy-intense sexual chemistry. 

I keep thinking that I'm in a dream, because he certainly is my dream man, everything I ever wanted and never thought I'd find all in one package. I've had challenges in the past with abusive/toxic relationships, so I honestly worked very hard to find happiness, security, and value in my own life as a single woman. I never dreamt I'd find a love this spectacular, yet always hoped that it was out there somewhere.

Justsk8n,"Thank you to my best friend, for always encouraging me to do my best","Just recently, I was helping my little brother with some schoolwork, and it reminded of some of my happiest memories as during school. I figured here would be as good a place as any. I met my very good friend as early as kindergarten, and he helped me and everyone else in our friend group so much. All throughout grade school, and even highschool he was the best friend anyone could ask for, but there was always one thing he did that constantly puts a smile on my face. Me and the rest of our friends weren't always that motivated to due schoolwork, and you'd often hear me say something along the lines of ""I don't feel like studying for this test"" or even as far as ""I'm fine with failing this project completely."" Despite that, my best friend was there everytime. The thing that was amazing about him, was how he would encourage me to do work in school. Anytime there was a project, he'd tell me 'if you get a passing grade, I'll give you $20 and I'll come over and play COD with you.' He told me much later he would mow lawns and shovel driveways to save up enough money to have the money to do that, because he had started it all the way back in grade 5. He would spend so much of his time, sometimes even hours a day in order to save up enough money to encourage me to do great in school, and create a worth ethic that still holds true in me to this day. I have no idea how my school life would have been without him, or even my life in general, but it makes me so happy that he was always there for me. Everyone in life deserves a friend like him, and I believe if everyone had support like that the world would be such a great place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gue5n5/thank_you_to_my_best_friend_for_always/,2020-06-01 04:49:00,2,1,0

Privateski,I did it. I finally did it. I made (non-toxic) friends!,"It was so awesome to hang out with them! They turned down vodka shots twice and we slowly drank beers and watched twitch. We laughed and I admired their Star Wars collection. We ordered pizza and I gifted them cat treats as a thank you for welcoming me into their home. We talked about current issues in today’s world and they didn’t ask me for a three some! Gosh, as I’m typing this I’m really realizing how fucked up my choice of friends is.. I was so excited that I quickly called my guy friend and told him about the amazing time I had with these good people! Eeeeee I’m so happy that I have good friends for once. My mom is going to be so happy when she meets them. 

Finally cutting off contact with my (toxic) best friend was a good decision that I should have done a while ago. She would get inside my head and convince me that everyone around me was insecure and jealous of our relationship. That wasn’t the case at all. It was her who was the problem, not everyone else.

MatijaZ98,Do you know what Amor Fati means? not the meaning of the word but the whole concept?,"So I've been reading about Amor Fati for a long time now. But I've only grasped the idea and really practiced it this past year and I've got to tell you. I feel a lot better and a lot stable in my life now. I used to get distressed about many new things in my life, mostly the bad experiences. But this past year I really got into it and realized that a lot of the things that happen to us are useless and stressful but they all pass and we forget about them. My mindset this year was that many things don't have a purpose in our lives but WE CAN give them a purpose.

I dissect the Word Amor Fati in my most recent post, go through what the stoic philosophers who introduced us to the whole concept said and meant.

My boyfriend and I were able to go for a walk and it was so much fun just walking and spending meaningful time together. We live together and we are both quite independent so it meant a lot to be able to spend some time together in that way. He's now playing games with his friends online and I'm intermittently feeding him snacks. I know it's a small thing but it makes me feel so calm and fulfilled.

itsglennz,Met My Long Distance Girlfriend from Scotland for the First Time (Video),"Glenn (from LA) had the opportunity to visit me for the first time after talking to each other online for almost two years. Ever since meeting online, we have been talking for hours almost everyday. He managed to spend Christmas, New Year's, and my 18th Debut with me.

Being in a long distance relationship is really hard, but we are determined to stay strong. We are tested and doubted every day, but we still prove to each other that it’s worth it. That is what makes the relationship so special. Distance is just an obstacle that we both can overcome and we are truly blessed to have each other.

CaliBounded,I've actually started to make friends for the first time in a few years!,"So I come from an abusive home, and was homeless from the age of 17 to 20 as a result of my abusive parent (I am now 23). Being homeless and moving from state to state and city to city, I had to be able to judge people's characters very quickly to keep myself safe. My gut is usually right about things. However, I recognize that when we're in danger, the skills that were appropriate while we were in a dangerous situation aren't always applicable in other situations in life. For example, the alertness that a soldier has during battle is totally appropriate and can keep them alive, but for a veteran re-entering society, that alertness becomes paranoia, and is a detriment to their social lives.

As a result of my three years of being in the proverbial trenches myself, I am not quick to trust people. I was under tremendous amounts of emotional strain from being abused by people I was staying with, people attempting to assault me, etc. When I typically had a bad feeling about someone, I was right. But now, I feel like sometimes I'm hyper-vigilant. I hate liars and people who take advantage of others, and if there's even a tiny inkling that someone is that kind of person, then I stay away from them. But I feel like this ""filter"" that I have also sometimes filters out good people too.  Having been hurt by so many people makes me not really want to be social at all - I'd rather swallow a handful of grapes all at once than talk about the weather. I've also just had 3 large friendships end over the last 2 years because they were lying to me in some *really major* way, or taking advantage of me, so I'm very cautious. What's weird is that I work a room really well, make people laugh, and do some public speaking stuff(and I'm told I'm pretty darn good at it). So people insist that I'm an extrovert because I'm charismatic and great at networking and socializing, but in reality, it really drains me unless there's something to gain from it (a new client, potential job, a passion of mine that I'm volunteering for, etc.) and Id rather be home cuddling with my dog and watching Unnus Annus.

I decided to be a lot more social now that COVID has hit. Even though I'm kind of antisocial, it doesn't mean that I'm not lonely. I've been doing pretty good at it too! I'm making it a point to actually follow-up with people that I used to talk to, but my time trying to survive homelessness made it too hard to keep up with those relationships. I now have a new friend I've met on Reddit that I chat with every day, and she's super neat, and another girl who's in the same field as me (also met through Reddit) that I'm going to visit through Animal Crossing, as well as some of my mentors that I usually only talked to about work stuff that I'm now working on developing personal relationships with. Those have been going awesome! And I'm working with my therapist to address the underlying issues that make it hard for me to make friends. I just talked for two and a half hours last night with this senior developer (I'm a junior software developer) that I met once because we were both stranded on a train that managed to crap out on us haha. It was so nice to both chat with someone that had a similar mindset as me AND worked in the same field as me.  I feel like this has all been affecting my mood in a really positive way, and it's a little scary, but I plan to keep it up c:",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gsu25f/ive_actually_started_to_make_friends_for_the/,2020-05-29 14:32:35,4,2,0

MatijaZ98,Does anybody else have a problem with caring too much about everything? Here is how I managed to control it,"The main issue for me was caring about what other people thought of me. I tried to please everybody, and it took a huge toll on me over the years. I would do everything at my job, taking up every task I could because that's who I was at that time. It took time and effort to control it. It all started when I quit the job I actually loved to start working on myself. I understand not everybody can just quit their jobs like that but what I am trying to say is to start from something, make a huge step in something and that will push you to start improving and working on yourself. And because you took that big step you will no longer be able to go back.

I write extensively about the stoic philosophy of not caring, have a read and subscribe to my blog at the top of the page, it would mean a lot to me. Thank you

ReelBack96,My friends swung by at 11PM on a worknight to see if I was okay,"I’m kind of a jerk. I generally only think about myself, and oftentimes I’ll go weeks without talking to people just because I don’t feel like. Over the years I’ve cut out 90% of the people in my life and failed to maintain relationships I’ve picked up along the way, including college and work friendships. I’m a hard person to get along with on the best of days.

But today, after three weeks of complete isolation thanks to social distancing and general laziness on my part, my best friend since the sixth grade drove out to my house on a work night to see if I was okay. He and another guy we both know from high school are pretty much the only people I’ve maintained a relationship since graduating, and we usually talk once a week or so. But occasionally I do things like this where I go AWOL for no good reason. They always find me anyway and treat it like no big deal. I want to be friends with these guys forever.

PS: We all wore masks and maintained social distancing during out conversation. Everyone please stay safe.

JaggaBomb,So I'm happy for something good came out of 2020,"TLDR : So there's this band called The Lovetones. And i just went to shuffle on their spotify, to find that they've released a new album. 

That made me happy today.


So let me establsih the premise here, I like to listen music, sometimes a lot. I'm a bedroom producer as well (of sorts).

Now there's this band called, The Lovetones. And I might've been a little low on my music listening sessions due to this job i have. But I still hold the same love for bands i used to listen in college. They're one such band. 

When I found them, it was on youtube, and google results wouldn't give any recent info about them. You can blame it their algo at the time, my potentially generic keywords, or the bands anonymity. So for some time i just hooked onto their youtube stuff.  I didnt have spotify for far too long, because :
 a. it wasnt officially available in my country ( India - our covid numbers are rising!)
 b. Youtube has a comparably good recommendation algo, if you're in the lesser popular part of it. People don't acknowledge it, but yeah, i said it.


Now fast forward, i chose to play them on shuffle today on spotify, where I hadnt visited them in a while. I see that they have  a new album out, and the first song is ""The Circle Turns"" and i just realised how sure i was that i'd never hear new stuff from them.

Some people don't know how that feels, to not hear from some artist you like anymore. 
My fellow hiphop heads would know.

And that! made me happy today - to experience a revival. They released an album after 10yrs, this year. 

I'm happy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gqqk66/so_im_happy_for_something_good_came_out_of_2020/,2020-05-26 04:52:20,1,3,0
GlitteringGlass,"Million Dollar Listing: From 2 Years of finding my passion, and working my ass off...","At 16, I fell in love with real estate. After lots of crying, praying, and overall doubting myself- On my graduation at 18, I made the decision to pursue real estate instead of going to college. 

I started with an ""investor"" job in real estate, with inconsistent pay. Then I quit- out on a limb for a commission-based job, and then with that company, graduated to a job that is around 35k a year, plus bonuses. Doesn't sound great, but I work for someone who does the same thing as me (Just much better, and much more experienced) and so it's training on exactly what I do for myself!! And it is very flexible, so I can do what I need to for my book of business as well.

It's been hard- really hard- and I've doubted myself a lot during the process. I put in long hours, and felt like I was putting everything into it. I ultimately only did 2 rental listings, and 1 condo sale.

&amp;#x200B;

carinace,Bestfriends for 8 years and then we got together! Cute inspiring (i hope so) story of my love life ☺️,"I'm in a relationship with my bestfriend. He was my friend for 8 yrs until we finally got together.

Back in college, he was my buddy. He was the guy who would always make me laugh but i try to hide the smile/ laughter anyway. He always made sure that i would know his favorite songs and carefully put the other earphone on my right ear so we could hear his fave song together. I would pretend being annoyed by that gesture, but deep inside i was exploding with happiness and ""kilig"" (a filipino term for giddiness). I've witnessed his heart breaks, his shallow relationships, and he was there when i got into my first serious relationship. I was so happy with my relationship, i was distracted making it work and i forgot about my best friend. He transferred to a different school, far away from me, from his college buddies. He became a different person to me as months and years go by. The only updates that I heard about him was stories, ridiculous stories, from our mutual friends. 

We went through different relationships, bouncing in and out of relationships for 4 years until we found each other again. He was different. Different from the party guy I've known from the stories of our friends. He grew his hair long, even his facial hair. He's wearing black everyday. He smiles only timidly now, not the guy I knew in college that would smile widely. He was in a place in his life where he's really focused on doing what he wanted to do. He didn't care about the opinions and judgements of others. He knows his true self now. 

He found me at the time of rising up from a loss. I just got out of my 2nd relationship. It was pretty serious. I thought i would die. (Now i know that i wouldn't) A week before we talked again, I went to a 4-day vacation away from the city. I went to Ilocos to do some soul searching. I came back happy. I came home thinking that I could be happy again without my ex. And i really did. So going back, a week later, my best friend commented on my post and then we chat through the comment box and moved our conversation to messenger app. We talked all day all night about random things. About life, about politics, about food.. EVERYTHING. I  felt like we're in college again. We talked everyday. And i noticed how fond i am with him, even though he's miles away. He didn't leave me hanging too. We confessed our feelings to each other and it went smoothly. It felt natural. It felt like, it could happen even before. Months passed by, and we officially became a couple. The happiness we've felt that time is still the same and grew even more today and everyday. 

There are times that i would cry because of happiness and gratitude that he's in my life. We understood each other and we held on to each other no matter what. I've never felt love this way before. I've never known someone as much as I know him, and he knows me too that well. Everything was worth it, every heart break, every disappointments, every downfall, because it led me to finding him again and love him like I never loved anyone else before. 

I hope all of us will find the happiness we all deserve. Even if we went through some hard times, there will always be a light at the end of the tunnel. Just keep praying, hoping, loving and living. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gq3nkb/bestfriends_for_8_years_and_then_we_got_together/,2020-05-25 03:36:13,1,2,0

conifer13,BIG surprise and I can't stop smiling and occasionally screaming and dancing with happiness! My student loan is paid in full and this is SUCH a big deal way beyond the money.,"This happened yesterday, I am still struggling to deal with it but in a very good way......I think. I needed to share and it's not something for my RL networks.

I checked my monthly pay that went into my bank account yesterday. It was noticeably higher than normal, which is odd because I'm on a fixed salary, get no overtime or allowances, and any pay increases only happen in August. I went online to check my pay slip and there it was - no student loan deduction made. I only get a SL statement once a year and it's been a while since the last, but at that point I'd calculated my repayments would finish at the end of this year. So this was right out of the blue. I checked with payroll department and yes, they have received notice on 1st of the month to stop taking payments.

Well this is amazing news for anyone of course, and the extra money is going to be FANTASTIC - or will be when lockdown ends and I can get out and use it (not that I'm ungrateful for being safe and still able to work).

But for me this is so much more.

I have had a very difficult relationship with all things relating to my university experience. Right from when I applied - I'd wanted to take a year out before going, parents wouldn't let me, I then wasnt accepted for any of my applications (and this was on the back of me being top of every class at school with tons of extra curricular and volunteer work and everything else you could possibly want). I ended up having to take a year off so I could reapply, but it was too late to be able to do my original plans so I just got a job and watched all my friends leave town. Plus I had to endure my dad not speaking to me for 6 months solid (while I was still living with my parents). Huge mess.

Second time round I got into a world-renowned university.....but halfway through my studies I had a complete mental breakdown...nvm why. PTSD, suicide attempts, very bad stuff. Eventually I dropped out because of it. My parents' reaction to this was so severe that I couldn't possibly move home, had to cut off contact for a while in fact because of the toll it was taking on me dealing with their destructive and controlling and demeaning behaviour. 

This was also just as the credit crunch happened and there I was with no degree, no confidence or support, a suddenly very restricted and competitive job market, trying desperately to keep a roof over my head because to go home would have literally killed me. I racked up credit card debt just to pay the basic bills, I had no social life and lost all my friends, I had to live in a hostel for a while and in many squalid and dodgy places after that too. Trying to explain dropping out of a very prestigious university to potential employers was impossible. As was trying to deal with my mental health and financial problems. Had to take the first job I could get and spent the next 10 years or so trapped in an awful attempt at a career I hated and that made me die inside every day.

I honestly don't know how I got through it.

And all the while the interest was piling up on this 5-figure sum of SL debt.....for which I had absolutely nothing to show. Every year I'd get a statement showing that the interest accrued was more than what I'd repaid, so the debt kept growing and I honestly thought I would never be free of it until I die.

I was so trapped by all of this for such a long time. Doing soul-destroying work because I had no other choice, for nightmare bosses. Living in squalor. Trying to deal with debt and mental health problems. Having no support network. So many times I came close to ending it.

Oh and another real kicker was when I eventually decided to go back to finish my degree to try and break out of this cycle, but because of the funding rules I could not get a further student loan to do so, and would have to pay £9k per year tuition fees UPFRONT from my own pocket, plus living expenses. Not possible.

Dark days. Dark years in fact. But bit by bit it eventually got better.

Through very frugal living I managed to balance my budget. It meant no social life for years and that has done lasting damage to the relationships of my youth, destroyed most of them in fact. But I paid down my credit cards and eventually started to save.

What took longer was building up my confidence and finding better work. I still don't exactly love what I do but there is at least meaning to it, and variety and challenge. And that's good enough. Plus through hard work and a fair dose of good luck I have managed to become moderately successful. I lead a team, although I still so often feel like an imposter. I'm surrounded by people not just with degrees but extensive postgrad study, doctorates, etc. I even manage some of them. To be in my position without a degree is very unusual. But however difficult and 'not me' the work may sometimes be it is at least work I can take pride in.

It's perhaps ironic that I now work at a university. And even now there are days when that is in itself very hard because I see so much of where my life could maybe have gone instead.

So for all these years - about 14 of them - I've had this SL debt hanging over me, reminding me what a waste it was, always pulling me back to all the things I went through because of that failed attempt at study.

And now - BAM! With one glance at my monthly pay, it's all gone. The debt is gone. The last tangible link to all that horrible history is gone. The fact that it was a surprise has made the impact even deeper.

I'm suddenly free of so much more than the financial debt. And I can't stop going nuts over it.

Bottle of bubbly has been popped 🍾

luovahulluus,"My happy birthday with good food, my partner and my girlfriends","It's my birthday. It's the first warm day of the spring in Helsinki, Finland. I'm sitting on a rock in a quiet park, listening the birds sing and watching my kids play. (The Eurasian blackbird has a lovely voice.)

My parner is at home, making burgers for dinner, and a mudcake for dessert. 

Last night my girlfriend slept over, for the first time ever. We haven't seen eachother for a *very* long time.

Tomorrow, we'll make tortillas. Me, my partner, my second girlfriend and the kids all together. Then my partner will leave, and me and this other girlfriend are going to have the next two days to ourselves.

On top of all this, I'm full of new relationship energy. Recently a new person was hired to my work place. There was instant chemistry between us. Last week we went biking together, and ended up making out for an hour. I had decided not to date anyone else, but I just couldn't resist her. She such a lovely woman. I really hope everything goes well and she'll become my third girlfriend. The next day she came over to our place, and the sex was amazing. She's the kind of energetic extrovert everyone notices. You know, the life of the party, always entertaining, and pretty too. (And, as it turns out, just the kind of kinky I love.)

Current_Bonus,I am a single parent . Today my son asked me to leave my job.,"I am from India. I had undergone 9 years of domestic violence. One day I was beaten black and blue that it showed all over my body and I could not move an inch, I walked away with my 7 year old kid. My ex was highly educated. But he was a big time narc.

I had no support financially. My mother alone looked after my child when I did multiple jobs ( teaching various subjects at college level) . I have endured a lot of hardships. Most were financial. The rest were the harsh words of people, especially those who were not even close to me. Some laughed at my plight. Many accused me of unpalatable things. I was stupid back then. I let it all affect me. I went into depression. Yet I never stopped learning new things.

I can proudly say that my son is what he is today because of my own efforts.

My kid is 24 now . He is earning a lot. He is afraid that if I have to go out I might catch infection So he said that I rather stop working.

He showers love on me and pampers me to bits. I reminded of my dead dad and grandpa. I miss them so much . I never thought that after them someone else can shower love on me this way .

My son makes me laugh . He is awesome company.

Suddenly after he saying so , I seem to have lost most of my fears. I feel, now I can give 0 fucks very easily.

IridiumTrigger,I Just Realize A Piece Of Advice From Long Ago Is So True,"A really long time ago, someone told me not to be afraid to take risks and be vulnerable, because that is what you need to do to make happy memories and get somewhere in life. It always made sense to me, but I just realized something that highlighted how true it is.

I started dating my very first girlfriend my junior year of high school, she was a senior. She was my sister's good friend, and when my sister went off to college we started talking, and soon I asked her out. I think I knew even at the time that the odds were completely against this relationship. She was the number 1 student in her class, destined for Ivy League. I had another year at school left, and we would likely if we stayed together a whole year be doomed to a 4 year long term relationship if we tried to make it work.

I went with my heart, and we were madly in love for the next year, but of course it ended after she went away. I ended up breaking up with her, but we both new it was coming. I think I narrowly beat her to the punch. It broke my heart and hers, and at the time I regretted ever letting myself fall in love.

11 years later, and I just thought about her for the first time in God knows how long, months, years. However, I realize my perspective is totally changed. I don't remember what the pain felt like. I don't remember missing her, and I certainly don't miss her now. I don't feel the echo of a hole that was left in my life all those year ago, all those relationships ago. 

The only thing I can really remember is the enormous love I felt for her. How sweet and cute she was. Our first kiss, her laying her head on my shoulder or my chest. Laughing until we couldn't breathe (I have no idea about what).The joy I felt sneaking out to meet her, and laying in a field under the stars all night talking about everything we wanted to do. It was so pure and uncomplicated, I haven't spoken to her in probably 10 years, I have no idea where she lives, what she does, what her life is, but she is still a part of me and it's a good part.

Hey, Reddit,

after  almost 3 years of development my first app is now finished and will be  released soon in the App Store. I could not be prouder.

Name  of the app is turning point. It combines several apps into one.  Habittracker, calendar, moodtracker and a daily journal + statistics.

I  came up with the idea of the app because it annoyed me to have to use  several apps for my daily organization. Habit tracker for habits,  calendar for appointments, reminders for trivial things (shopping etc.),  mood tracker and diary.

I also had a normal success journal on paper, but I couldn't follow my development there or at least it was very time consuming.

Besides, the number of apps slowly went into the money.

I'm convinced that if you use the app every day, your life will improve significantly.

At least this is already the case in my life. :-)

We  also built in a vision board at the beginning, which asks you about  your life goals, annual goals, 3-month goals and monthly goals and which  daily habits you can implement to achieve your goals. These are then  added to your daily dashboard and you can see them at a glance along  with your appointments and normal trivial tasks.

We  call the app ""Wendepunkt"" - which means turning point in english.  Wendepunkt because it can really change your life for the better.

Each  of these habits that ""pays in"" to one of your goals, we call turning  points, because they bring you closer to your true self. Anyone who has  read James Clear knows about the power of habits and small steps.

You can assign the turning points in 7 areas of your life to ensure that you maintain an even balance between the areas.

Because what good is a million dollars in your bank account if your relationships are bad?

The 7 categories are:

* Physis
* Emotions
* Lifetime
* Relations
* Career / Vision
* Finances
* Spirituality

There are also 6 daily questions that ask you about your day and your plans for the day. 3 in the morning and 3 in the evening. 

What you are thankful for, and what you have learned. In this journal you also record your mood, how you felt that day.

Once a week you will receive 3 more questions that will give you more depth and help you reflect on your life.

In  each month you can see in which of the seven areas of your life you  have developed. At the beginning you determine your starting point in  the vision board, how you are doing in the 7 areas of life.

I  am honest. I would never have thought that this ""small"" project would  be so elaborate, but the logic and conception was much more extensive  than I thought.

For now the app is only available in German, but we plan to launch it in other languages as soon as possible.

I know, the app is far from being perfect, but it is honest. :-)

I'm curious if the app will be well received and if it will be able to cover a demand on the need of people.

Let me know your thoughts.

You  could find Screenshots and Impressions on our website. Sorry that is  all in german, but i guess the purpose of the app will be visible.

datbeckyy,Just a bit of good news has lifted my sunken spirits... I am so welcoming of this newfound self-confidence and motivation. I CAN do it.,"Like many of us during the pandemic, I have spent months feeling utterly useless, and especially stagnant in my career &amp; education advancements. My MCAT exam was canceled, graduate offices have been closed, and no phone calls or emails have been answered. I have been desperate to move forward or at least solidify a PLAN. 

Today I FINALLY received my undergrad transcript in the mail, and I was finally able to calculate my “major-GPA” (my major was biology with a focus in medicine, which included several additional courses that are required for medical school). I knew that my “overall-GPA”, which included some “fluffers” such as ceramics, drawing, etc., was over 3.0. However, the masters, research-based thesis program I am dreaming of getting into (hosted by the medical school I also dream of getting into) lists admission standards as all the credits I have, plus an overall-GPA *AND* major-GPA of above 3.0. I will not lie, I had a few struggles with my chemistry courses, even receiving exactly 1 official D in my very last semester of undergrad in organic chemistry 2. 

I was happy to have my transcript but petrified to calculate my major-GPA. What if it was below 3.0?? This is arguably the best program for Biomedical Science in my state. This masters program is even in the city I live in, and like I said, at the medical school I hope to attend after earning another degree (hopefully this one!!) with a higher GPA than I received in undergrad, when I partied a bit too much. 

As long as I did the math right (which I’ve re calculated again and again) turns out that BOTH my major and overall GPA’s are well above 3.0!!! I am so relieved. Now I just need to get my letters of recommendation and hopefully score a bit better than my first attempt on my upcoming MCAT exam. Which I *know* I can do if I work hard enough. If I can tie these loose ends, I have a real, legitimate chance of getting into this program- which will only makes my ultimate dreams all the more possible!

I just wanted to share this with some strangers, because I’m sure if I run around shouting it to the rooftops I will look both insane and entirely demanding of attention when I do not yet deserve it, because I had not actually been accepted yet, just some good news. This post came out longer than intended so even if it gets no attention here, I just wanted to say I am HAPPY, and I sincerely hope you guys are too =)) Thanks to anyone who read, peace and love!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gkm90t/just_a_bit_of_good_news_has_lifted_my_sunken/,2020-05-16 01:46:19,1,11,0
budgie02,My Great Aunt is coming home from the hospital.,"This seems so small but she has mine suffering from covid since early April, we got a call from her husband about it and have only gotten information about her from him. About a week ago she was moved from care to recover from her dialysis to a rehabilitation center for her walking, since she was bedridden for a long time. Two days ago we heard from my grandfather, my great aunt’s friend had called her, and then called my grandfather. Today my mother got a text from her talking about how she had lost her phone and ID for a while and how she didn’t answer my mother’s call that wasn’t long after we found out her friend called her because she was in therapy. I was so happy I broke down crying. She’s going home on Sunday too!

Aside from 5 minute phone calls and very few letters, we’ve barely talked all that time.

Seeing and hearing him melted away all my stress and worries and reminded me how excited I am to start the next chapter of our lives together. I can already see the things that changed in him that he learned while there and how much we’ve both grown from this experience.

vortoix,"After 5 years of guilt, today I forgave myself and the accompanying peace simply makes me happy and humbled.","This lockdown has been one of extreme introspection. I still feel there’s a long way to go, but I needed to undergo, almost 17 years of long overdue healing process.

I’ve been carrying around immense guilt for wronging an ex. After him, I’ve dated multiple people, but this guilt has stayed with me.

For almost 5 years now. This, even after I apologised to him and he was kind enough to forgive me.

As time went on, we drifted apart, only to wake up one day and see that he had deleted my number. He was seeing someone new, and I never wanted to get into the happy couples’ way. 

But I’ve punished myself repeatedly and always felt like apologizing to him— again and again. Only to realise today, seeking his forgiveness is actually me seeking validation— an acknowledgment from him that I’ve changed.

And this thought shifted my entire perspective. I suddenly realised what forgiving yourself means. It feels like a weight is lifted off my chest. I feel like I deserve beautiful things in life. I’m completely worthy of happiness.

I feel like I’ve finally healed from the past. And I deserve it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gk4w60/after_5_years_of_guilt_today_i_forgave_myself_and/,2020-05-15 07:54:24,1,3,0
blueish-waters,I am starting a YouTube Channel and need your help!,"Hello! My name is Grace and I am starting a YouTube Channel to help people curve their view and use of social media to be a little more positive. Social media has been tied to increases in anxiety, depression and many other mental health struggles. A lot of the time people feel they aren’t perfect or their lives aren’t perfect because we are constantly comparing them to others we see online. But I want to show people how just because someone’s life isn’t in the same place as others right now doesn’t mean it isn’t great! And that we can use social media to hold each other up. 

What I want to ask if for peoples something good stories! I want to hear YOUR feel good story. Not something you heard in the news, but something that made your heart warm because you worked hard, or am proud of someone. I want to read them in my videos and share goals, success, exciting news from all around the world and share it with others. I want to encourage people to follow others that share positive messages and ideas. 

Even if you don’t have a story right now, you will! So I still encourage checking it out and at least listening to other stories. I am super excited to hear good things in people’s lives and share them so just check out ‘Grace or Grey’ either here @ r/graceorgrey and leave your story or comment below.

It was so incredibly thoughtful of her! She’s also really not one, in my experience , for speaking about her feelings about anything. That includes about myself and her son. So this really felt like a meaningful gesture to me.

I decided to find new friends and gain some social skills, so I entered r/TeensMeetTeens and searched for some friends. I got a DM from a guy that said he would like to add me in a Snapchat group and I was happy with that.

The book takes places in the 1740s in colonial America. The protagonist is an American-born soldier in the British Army that has been tasked with protecting colonists that are building a new settlement. 


What I'm hoping you think:

- The 1740s? That's not a time I'm interested in reading about.

- Combat back then was so slow and boring.


What I'm hoping I will prove:

- Being completely isolated with horrible communication capabilities in a foreign area is terrifying.

- You had (at most) three good shots per minute if you were an elite soldier. You had to make those shots count. The most horrifying words you could hear was ""fix bayonets"" while you stare into the void of a dark forest, war cries echoing between the trees.

ChiliDogMe,Finally! 18 years after high school I have graduated fr college!,"I was such a good student in high school. I had a 3.7 GPA and showed alot of promise. After high school I was a pretty big bum. I had some freedom finally so I partied. Too much. In my early 20's all I cared about was getting messed up and video games. I was taking classes off and on but not taking them seriously. Changed my major about three times. 

When I was 25 I joined the NAVY. Did 8 years and grew up. I met my wonderful wife and had a beautiful son. After the military I went back to school. I pretty much had to start all over. Most of the credits I had already completed didn't count. But I was a much better student this time. I made mostly A's. I had a 4.0 my first semester and made the president's list of the University. 

This semester was my potential last one and I had to take a computer science class for my major. Intro to C++. I made a 29 on the first exam. I hade a 59 in the class heading into the final. But I did good on the final. Today I got my final grades back and it was enough to pass! I will soon have a BS in Geography. 

My wife just graduated from a Medical Technical College as well! I can't walk because of the virus but I'm still so happy. We are drinking a bottle of champagne tonight to celebrate. Next up is grad school. 

Keep at it y'all. It may take awhile but don't stop. And for you young folks, take school seriously. Like really. Just do the homework. Turn in the assignments on time. Go to class.

PM_ME_TODAYS_VICTORY,"For the very first time in years, I just woke up from an uninterrupted full night's sleep actually feeling well-rested and energized right out of bed. Best night of sleep I've ever had.","I know it's probably just some weird chemical imbalance, but I feel positively **euphoric**. I've become accustomed to waking up a few times in the middle of every night, and oftentimes waking up extremely early (anywhere between 2:30-4:30am) with my mind racing, being unable to fall back asleep at all, so I just start my day. And without fail, no matter when I wake up, I feel like absolute garbage and it takes a while for me to feel normal (let alone excited about my day).

But this morning... I don't know what it is! I went to bed around 9pm and woke up right at 6am and I have an incredible amount of energy. I didn't wake up AT ALL and didn't feel glued to my bed. It's the most perfect night of sleep I've ever had.

Now I'm just trying to figure out everything I did to make this happen... it was pretty cool, so that helped. I had a normal, nutritious dinner about 3 hours before going to sleep. I still had a good amount of screentime before bed, but nothing insanely stimulating/distracting.

MermaidSplashes,"I have been babysitting a nonverbal autistic five year old boy. After about of month of work, he now knows how to sign in ASL to pushed while he's on the swing. I am so proud of him!","With covid moving college classes online, I found a job babysitting a 5 year old, nonverbal, autistic boy. His dad, a single father, reached out to me through a babysitting app. He had a lot of trouble finding a reliable person to watch him, with several people having bailed after a couple of days. 

I was a bit worried at first as I don't have any training or experience babysitting with autistic or nonverbal individuals. However, his dad was very understanding and really did a ton to help ease me into the job. Plus, I knew I would have a unique opportunity to learn and 25hrs a week of works well with my academic load.

The boy, who I'll refer to as Liam for privacy's sake, is very active and curious. Liam is most often on the underwhelmed senses side with his autism. He likes super acidic or bitter tasting food and is sensitive to texture. He'll eat limes plain and likes unsweetened coco powder. Liam likes chewing and biting to explore things. The first couple of days I worked with him, I got bitten several times, but has stopped as he's gotten to understand and that it's not an accepted way to express himself. He has all sorts of ideas and wants to communicate them, but so far his speech therapist has only gotten through a few ASL signs (more, food, etc) and a food picture chart. Sometimes he throws tantrums when he gets upset 

Over time, I've really become fond of him. We go on tons of walks on trails since the parks are closed and he always holds my hand. I bought some rain boots so we can jump in puddles together. His giggles are contagious and I don't especially have to understand what's funny in order to join him. I even overheard one of the neighbor kids ask their mom if i was his older sister, which melted my heart a bit. 

I want to help him be able to communicate and so I've been working on learning some more ASL. I follow the advice of his speech therapist with practising what he knows, but I also wanted to find ways to implement it more.

One of those ways I came up with was the swing. Liam loves the swing in their back yard and goes on it several times a day. I started slowly with him. Every time he got on the swing, I showed him the push sign with my hands. He kinda tried to copy me, but just mostly waved his arms around or did other signs like food.

So for a few days, I showed him the sign and then used my hands to completely form and guide his motion. He had to do this often as I'd push him pretty high and then naturally let the swing slow down. Naturally, he'd want to swing again, so we'd practise again. Eventually, he began to get the form right, but not the motion. So I'd guide him by facing my open palms to his and directing him to push. Once he got that down, I took a few steps back from the swing so he couldn't use my hands to rely on. I would let him try on him own, and if he got it right, he'd get the quick reward of being pushed. If he didn't, I'd show him from a distance. If he still didn't get it, but was begining to become frustrated, I'd step forward and guide him with my hands again.

It was slow progress. It's taken a bit under a month for him to get where he is now. But now he can sign without any encouragement or help from me. He's happy about it, and I'm so very proud of him! I'm working on the sign for help with him now and working on potty training (he wears diapers atm) but I'm just so happy at his success right now!!! Every time he signs it I just want to jump up and down and can't help grinning.

TL;DR After about a month of practise and hard work on both sides, an autistic, nonverbal five year I babysit now knows the ASL sign for push for the swing and we're both excited about it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ged73u/i_have_been_babysitting_a_nonverbal_autistic_five/,2020-05-06 04:23:18,1,47,0

MichiganLion,"I struggle with binge eating, but I recently made my wife cry when putting on a shirt.","I’ve struggled with binge eating all of my life, and my marriage has felt the negative effects of the ugly side of my problem. I would extensively lie about what I was eating. The mistrust that bred between my wife and I was much worse than the food I told myself I couldn’t stop eating. 

But... with her incredible, consistent support things slowly began to get better. I started my journey at 344 pounds. I’ve worked on finding healthier ways to manage my mental health &amp; stress. I’ve incorporated exercises into my routine as my body began to feel better. 

It’s been just over a year and I now weigh 217 pounds. I was putting on a button up shirt that barely fit in the Fall and was happy to see that it was fitting more comfortably. My wife looked up, smiled, and then began to tear up. The moment was a reflection of how far we’d come. 

She was proud of me, sure, but the weight lost is also a symbol of our commitment to each other. To be as healthy as we can for us and our children. 

I’m still reaching for various fitness goals, but I’m so happy that these changes in my habits have begun the difficult process of rebuilding trust with the most important person in the world to me.

Sheepish_Ammonite,"I'm finally going to conquer a ten year long fear, and I couldn't be happier!","For the past twn years I've been terrified of riding horses due to a freak accident while learning to ride and care for horses when I was younger. My mom's friend used to save abused horses and take care of them on a ranch that she co-owned with another friend of hers, and I used to love it honestly, I had a lot of fun learning and riding, it was a passion of mine back when... but eventually she wanted to put me on her horse, who was severly abused before she rescued him. He was about 16 hands high, and I was about 5'1 at the time, and I was quite terrified already as it was because he was enormous and I couldn't even get on him by myself let alone adjust properly... she decided it was a good idea to try getting on him with me, and although not her intention, he reared and I wasn't settled in yet. I wasn't thrown off, I clung to his reins for dear life, but I have never ridden a horse again since then. I've never even approached a horse since then come to think of it, I still love them and think they're gorgeous animals, just never really wanyed to try to overcome the fear of them I gained back when... I was much happier looking at them from a distance.

I'm an adult now though, and as I'm coming into possession of some land out in the country side, perfect for riding, I decided it might be a good time to try again. I realized that last summer actually, after seeing a bunch of horses on the beach out in Ensenada (Mexico), back then I just wasn't sure, and wasn't in the best mindset or mental health either. I'm much better this year, and once I buy the land out here I plan to start preparing a large section of yard for a horse, as well as taking classes again to properly learn how to care for a horse (as it's been years and I remember very little, I'd like to be properly prepared, not just hoof it and hope for the best).

I've done a lot of research about different breeds and their temperaments to see what would be best for me and I'm sure I've made my decision. It probably won't be this year, as I want to make sure to build a proper stable with all the horse will need, but I'm excited to tackle this and work past it! I've decided to get the horse as a foal snd raise it, as I was told by a friend this may also help make me more comfortable with the concept if I bond with the horse from a young age and onward, but I'm so happy and excited to finally be doing this, to finally want to push myself and achieve a goal like this! I've spent far too long wallowing in self pity and depression, always doubting myself and giving up because I just didn't have the energy or strength... it feels great, and I'm excited to make a life long friend and partner within the next year or two, I feel like this is going to help me in so many ways and I'm so ready for this change in my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gcn90u/im_finally_going_to_conquer_a_ten_year_long_fear/,2020-05-03 08:38:39,1,1,0

25thCenturyQuaker,Happy about College Admissions. Worried about the future.,"I’m a community college instructor at one of the worst community colleges in the US. I teach in a few different special programs that support equity. This week, out of 40-50 students per year in each program, I had three students accepted to UC Berkeley, two to UCLA, 5 more to other UCs, and about 12 to CalStates. Some of those students are undocumented. All are first generation college students. One of the best years we’ve ever had. 

My god.... I’m so happy for them. All of them. I mean, especially now. But every year the success stories floor me with how much they have to overcome just to be in community college, much less transfer. 

I always cry at graduation. I’ll miss that. But still.... it’s not about me. I hope they can celebrate and know that I care and love them. 

I had a student named Ana for several English classes. I probably didn’t know her name until now. She was quiet, got good grades, but didn’t participate much in class and kind of went under my radar. 

She passed. She behaved. She didn’t complain. She did her work. It was good. She was ok. I didn’t feel like I needed to do an intervention or anything. 

So she was right there in front of me and unnoticed. I focused on everyone else: the fails, the loudmouths, the behavior issues, the big shots, the “greasy wheels”, the narcissistic egomaniacs. She didn’t seem to need me. I didn’t really worry about her. She was and is right there in front of my face. For a year and a half. 

This semester in 103, she asked me after class one day if I’d read and edit her responses to the UC insight questions. I probably rolled my eyes and asked her what her name was for the 50th time and asked her to email me.  I get that a lot...every November... it’s kind of annoying because I am often overwhelmed with requests and it’s “crunch time” in all my classes and there’s usually a lot of committee work and other stuff to be done in the fall. You know, the “everything else besides teaching” that is somehow “your job.” 

She emailed me. When I glanced over her responses, at first I saw just the problems: a lot of grammatical errors and so I dreaded reading them, so I put it off. I know, it’s weird especially for me, but I hate doing sentence-level revisions. Plus, she was my student. I mean, WTF, didn’t I teach you anything?!?!? You can’t do better than this after three fucking semesters?!?! Don’t you know this application matters more than any easy solution be ever assigned you?!?! You know—that shit. 

Eventually, I read them. They weren’t as bad as I initially thought. There were some sentence issues, but in response to the question about obstacles she had overcome, she wrote about being homeless as a student, both in high school and in college. I “did the math.” While I was not noticing her in class, she was living in a car with her mother and sister in the parking lot of a MacDonald’s. She was working weekends to help her family. While walking “home”, she was picking up pennies from the sidewalk to give to her mother to contribute to the family food fund. On top of that, in another response, she wrote that she figured out that education is the key to upward mobility. She wants to be a lawyer. She will be. She wants to help her family. She already is. She wants to change her community by encouraging others from Pico-Union to go to college. She already has. They already are. 

She got into Berkeley this year. And she’sfoing.

I won’t overlook Ana. I can’t. She made me see her, silently. I learned something from her: she’s my job. She’s who I get out of bed in the morning for. Her and everyone like her. 

And, there is nothing that I won’t fight to the bitter end for her to have. She deserves every ounce of support that LASC has, no matter what that support is. No, I mean she deserves more, way more, that what we have. She deserves all that we have AND more. 

I’m so worried that the backlash of paying for covid will defund education. Someone has to pay. I remember the last recession. It wasn’t pretty. It was horrible. State funded schools depend on the state budget, which when it tanks, results in budget cuts to schools, emergency services, nurses, hospitals, police, social services...everything that matters to me. 

During the recession, we laid off faculty and student demand went through the roof, because people go back to college when the job market is bad. But that’s when tax revenue is low and the budget is cut. 

I’m happy for my students now but worried about the future generations. We have to make sure that this pandemic does not affect social services.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gc9eeu/happy_about_college_admissions_worried_about_the/,2020-05-02 16:35:23,2,3,0

Ceurx,I worked through the hardest time of my life for my kids," 

I am not sure if this is the right place to post, but ill give it a shot

If you look at my post history its been a rough time for me lately, i wont go into it but the TLDR is

Wife kicked me out after a 15 year relationship, gave up in marriage counseling, told me she wanted a divorce, then 4 days later went on a date. at one point i was:

living in my grandparents basement for 2 months

Unemployed

No money

Up to my eyes in debt

Depressed

Suicidal

The past year, iv basically been living in a bedroom, i landed a good job saved some money so i could take over the rent at my old place, when i was at my grandparents i lived out of a bedroom, and when i finally moved back to my old apartment (wife moved out to her grandmas townhouse who had recently died, and doesn't pay rent ). I basically lived in my bedroom as i was depressed and just not in a good place and didint want to do anything. I did get a roommate to help with the rent and i just plugged along, doing therapy, divorce support groups and just working through my feelings as best as i could.

I have the kids part time (custody issues currently going on, not going into to much here though) but my big thing was i live in a room, and the weekends i have the kids they want to play and run around, and its hard to do that in a small bedroom. They do go to the rest of the apartment on occasion but i have to watch them like a hawk to make sure they dont break my roommates stuff or get into trouble.

This led to me feeling like a bad dad, cause all we did was watch tv most of the time, we played and did what we could but i knew they wanted to run around and be kids (they are 3, and 5) and it broke my heart knowing they couldn't. i buckled down and focused on work, did door dash on the side. saved my money and stopped eating out as much and just really focused on whats important right now. and that was to get my own place for my kids sake.

I worked so fucking hard over the past few months to make this happen i fought depression, setbacks, massive emotional swings that would normally knock me out for sometimes days and kept my eye on the prize.

Im happy to announce as of today, I have reached the payout for my work, I just got news my application for my new apartment was accepted. Its a 2 bedroom 1 bath so the kids have their own room and tons of place to play with a balcony. I can finally give them to space they deserve so they can play and run around and be happy. I finally got money saved up for all my move in costs and had some left over and i did it for them.

The amount of space that im gaining honestly may seem like not a lot to most people but im effectively going from a 200 square-foot studio, to a 950 2 bedroom.

No matter what struggles you guys are going through if you focus on what you want and focus on your goals i know you can get to where you need to get to.

Chloed12345678,I just remembered this and it made me happy that I choose the right thing :),"This was a couple months ago and I just remembered it and wanted to share my experience. I was on the train with my friend going to my orchestra and we were about to get off in a couple of stops. I was freaking out about school applications which were coming out in a couple of minutes and were a really big deal because the schools had one or two spots for the grade that I am entering next year. All of a sudden there is this screaming coming from the little space in between the two subway car doors (for people who don't live in NYC there are two subway cars with a little platform connecting them on the outside of the train with almost no protection that are keeping people from falling off or preventing any accidents or deaths.) I look over and see a homeless man screaming ""I am going to jump off I want to die"" repeatedly over and over again. My friend and everybody else in our train car is just ignoring this and acting like nothing is happening because they are used to ""crazy"" people at this point. I'm looking at my friend and say to her that we should get him into the train car and to safety because he is lifting his leg over the side about to jump. My friend turns to me and says stop making a big deal about this its not your business so just stop. At this point the man is halfway over the rope and is about to jump over the side of the train and commit suicide, so I decided then and there that I couldn't let this man die because it is another human beings life on the line and If the adults in the train are too dumb and pretentious to doing anything I might as well. I started talking to the man and trying to coax him into coming back into the train where it is safe and after a couple of minutes of talking to him and telling him that he was deserving of a good and long life he finally came into the train car and was safe. I was approaching my stop and had to get off the train at that point but I made sure to let the conductor know that he was trying to jump and that he should keep looking to make sure the man was safe and out of harm's way. It was a really scary experience but I am really glad that I made the decision to not ignore him and to maybe make a small difference in someone's life. Anyways that's my story and I hope that if you are ever in the same situation you will make the right decision as well.

I’m currently unable to sleep, my body is just filled with excitement and I needed a place to express the level of joy that is currently rushing through my body. 

Since I was extremely young I’ve always known that I wanted to make something of music in my life and I’ve been taking opportunities as they’ve come up, started with the violin and moved to piano then to guitar and finally because of Guitar Hero of all things, I finally encountered drums and I instantly fell in love, after going through school playing drums in concert bands and other formed and disbanded bands outside of schools, I’ve met a group of people who I get along with so well and am playing a genre of music that I adore and love. After 2-ish years of being with this band I’ve finally realised my dream of being in a band that has released music, with a whole album coming I’m just absolutely over the moon and literally shaking as I write this.

honeybeary,Today my puppy was born. Today also happens to be MY birthday too.,"My dog who was my best friend died two years ago. I went in to a deep depression. This dog helped prevent me from killing myself and so much more. For a long time, he was my only friend. Losing him really, truly broke my heart. 

I recently decided to try to open my heart again, so I put a non-refundable deposit on a puppy. Immediately I regretted it, felt like I wasn't ready. I cried (sobbed) for hours that day. I felt like I was betraying my dog and it all just felt too real and I just didn't feel ready. Slowly I warmed up more to the idea. 

Anyway, the momma was due april 20th, but she just gave birth today, April 23. Today is also my birthday. I really like to believe my dog in heaven had a part in this. Somehow making me bond more to this puppy.

All of my life my goals was to make my mom and dad proud. My mom is very emotional and I'm so close to her and I love her to bits but no matter how much I try I could never get close to my dad as much as I am with her.

They're both supportive of whatever I do but I always try to do things that make them proud. I don't mean to say my dad is emotionally dead he is very effectionate but I feel he expects more of me than I can ever be, considering all my siblings are doctors so it's a pretty high bar. I always felt he was more proud of them than he will ever be of me so I had no expectations. 


But just that today I finished my graduation project and I got a great review he just looked at me and smiled and just patted me on the back and didn't say anything. I just cried so fucking hard and I have no idea why. All i know is that I'm so happy that I am crying. My mom looked at me confused and I just left.

DreamerDmitriy,"Happy Style: a game that will improve mood and relieve stress. You will receive warm and motivational words, and reminders of your dreams and victories","Happy Style is an everyday mood enhancing application and a relaxing and energetic game.

The initial Happy Style concept was invented based on psychological observation: in nervous moments, people often try to get distracted by something, to find aimless work for their hands. For example, simply turn over the pages on the phone screen. I thought it would be interesting to do something with this, to add a bit of joy to the process.

So in Happy Style game levels for Relaxation were born, where in response to finger movements on the touch screen warm words appear: compliments from Happy Style or loved ones, the user's dreams, victories, wisdoms and even… complete nonsense. The goal is simple - to relax and enjoy the process.

Sometimes application sends notifications with a warm word, wisdom, a dream, or the achievement of its user - it's nice to remember that you are worth something.

Happy Style has already contains more than 1000 kind words for both men and women, as well as about 1000 wise quotes from great people. You can easily add new ones, you can record Kind Voices - voice messages from loved ones, and also keep journals of your achievements and dreams… and even your own collection of nonsense.

OneTrueSneaks,"I know they'll (probably) never see this, but to the ladies at WinCo last night:","It was late (relatively), and WinCo is one of the very few places still open after 9. I got there at 9:30, giving me just half an hour of shopping after work, myself being an 'essential' retail worker. Between being sore and tired from my shift on my feet and having a bad knee that has me walking with a cane, I'm amazed I made it through the store in only half an hour, getting to the register right as they're announcing it's closing time. 

When I get to the lone open register, I'm surprised to see there's only one person in front of me, and it's such a relief knowing I'll have less of a wait than I was dreading. And as I'm standing there, behind me come two more shoppers, each with a small handful of items. So I hobble myself back and to the side a bit, and wave you both forward. You both try to protest, but I've got more than double what you two have put together, and I don't mind waiting a little longer. You both thanked me and wished me a good night when you were done, and I did the same, and it was just such a pleasant thing to see people being so polite that it was worth the less than five extra minutes.

Simpull_mann,"I've never been a good student. Never wanted to go to college, but I pursued a degree nonetheless and even though I spent eight years on a BA, I can now officially call myself a college graduate as of today!!!","I'm just really happy and want to share it with others.

I was a transfer student and had to retake a ton of classes. Also my advisor hated me because her husband and I got in a dispute and the cops were involved. She misled me and I ended up taking way too many credits. Almost enough for two BAs.

I was trying to get a double major but before I could finish the government cut my financial aid funding because I had taken too many classes. I had to work and pay for my remaining classes out of pocket and today, after practicing guitar for weeks, I played four pieces of music for the music faculty members and went through their trial by fire just this morning.

And I passed. I've officially graduated and I'm just so overjoyed. I've honestly never felt so happy. I started crying when I told my girlfriend and Mom.

I never thought I had it in me but I guess I was wrong--even if it took nearly a decade.

Maybe I even have it in me to go further and pursue a Masters. The skies the limit!

I've got to believe in myself and keep growing!!

comeoneileen95,Good news during the crisis: I get to work again!,"Hey everyone, I just got great news that I would like to share with you all.

A little background info: I’m from Germany and I study primary school teaching. To support myself and to gain experience in my future work field I work as an inclusion aide. This means I go to school with a kid in second grade and support her, because she has diabetes. While she gets to focus on school, PE class, friends and happiness, I take care of her blood sugar levels and the insulin before breakfast.

In Germany schools have been closed starting March 19th, so I haven’t been able to work since then and missed the kids in the class and of course the money. Since I am a student I am not eligible to get the short-time unemployment benefit which is about 60% of your usual pay. 

Today I got the news that my city decided, that the inclusion aides can go to the kid’s houses and homeschool them if the parents want and need the service.

I just got the call from the mum who told me they would like to do that, if I am up for it. Since the dad works shifts and the mum works mornings, I will go there every second week starting May 4th! 

I am super excited that I finally get to do what I love again and of course that I will be getting paid again!! 


I hope all of your are happy, healthy and safe. I’m wishing all good things to come to each and every one of you. I’m over the moon right now.

Santorox2,"I finally got partially over my fear after internal battle with anxiety, a 'disability' and a few other things"," 

this post includes a little self promotion in the end which i got a  permission from a mod to do :)

Hi, my name is Michael.

I am a 24 man with high functioning autism and a small speech problem.

for many years i have wanted to to create educational videos about life/interesting stuff in the world (i also get many ideas from reddit) on youtube.

i started many channels but my because of my anxiety, hate comments about my video subjects/voice +the fact that english isn't my mother language and just general low self esteem i always gave up and quit/delete the channel.

well now, somewhat 10 year too late after i worked on myself i decided to start again.

i do still feel some insecurity about my voice and because of it at least for my first video/future videos i use a decent STT software. (this is why i wrote i just partially got over my fear lol)

i hope that soon i will be able to use my own voice and have a better self esteem.

as of this week i am going to try to upload bi-weekly (3-10) minutes about various interesting topics i find i the world.

i just uploaded my first video after years of not touching an editing software and doing this again reminded me how much i loved it. as i upload more videos i know my editing and video structure will get alot better!

i just wanted to generally thank the community of reddit because not matter how bad i feel some days or how bad and stupid is a question i want to know the answer for or if i just want to pass many hours with laughs and good times i know i can come here.

i know this is a little shameless but i do want to plug my channel and get people here to see, give me ideas, and good critique about how to make my video/video structure/ editing etc. better i really believe that this will be a part of my personal growth :)

it gets me very excited knowing there will be people here and in the world that will be with me from the start and witness my personal and professional development of my life and video making in the foreseeable future.

**i will not post here my channel but if you are interested you are welcome to dm me and ill send it to you in a message :) in addition to that if you just want to talk about life and ways of coping with disability wether it is autism or not you are more then welcome to send me a message :) i would love to talk to you!**

Backstory:
Basically for the last almost 2 years I've been fairly reclusive after I had 2 separate mental breakdowns. I haven't spoken to anyone and dropped my number, social media, my job, everything, which was a LOT for me as I had a lot of friends at the time, and the handful of people I still spoke to after were: my parents (sometimes), my sister, my brother, my partner. That's it. Since 2018. 

Recently (February) after a very low period I went to hospital and have since been on a new medication, with a new therapist, and have a lot of support from different people/organizations.

It's slow but I've started going back on my old platforms and reconnecting with old friends and it's been pretty good! 

I've sent some messages out and while they might not all be positive responses (I dunno if they will be I'm still waiting) I'm happy I tried to reach out again. I'm slowly starting to feel like myself before the breakdowns and I'm feeling... happy. There's some bridges I'll have to try and mend eventually but I'm just feeling good and positive again and it's just a breath of fresh air! I can feel the colour coming back in to my life again!

I just wanted to share in my positivity! I don't know why I had to write this post but I just needed it out there in the universe!",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/g0hvwd/ive_had_a_difficult_couple_of_years_but_now/,2020-04-13 12:19:18,7,2,0
PopsicleJolt,So it turns out that my ambitious project IS achievable after all!,"I have two weeks to get seven short story fanfictions published. As an ameteur fanfiction writer, I thought this was unachievable. Last time I uploaded *one* story on time, it was a schedule that I made myself, and I had two weeks in total -one to write the first draft and one to edit/upload.

This time, it's a schedule someone else made, where I upload one fanfiction for each day of the week, based on a specific prompt and a specific pairing. I have two weeks to prepare for said event. So, basically, I have two weeks to write *seven* short stories, and I've organized my schedule into one story written every two days, with minor editing done right before I upload it.

I actually managed to follow my own schedule on such a short notice for once! Now that I know how to handle the length of this story and how much time I should expect to spend on productivity, hopefully the other six stories will be more efficient.

I'm so excited. This event is for my favorite OTP. Last time I participated, I wrote *one* oneshot. This time, I've improved since then, and I'm able to write all seven at this rate!

blablible123,Depressed dad is finally starting to become the man I remember him as.,"*This is really long I'm sorry ! I just really wanted to share it with someone.* 

A year ago, almost to the day, my mom left my dad after 30 years together. Out of the blue. I don't judge her, sometimes you just fall out of love. This however left my dad in shambles. 

A month from that he called me, asking me how he could find a therapist, since he thought he was depressed. Mental issues run in the family, but my dad had never gone through anything like this. I linked him up with my therapist (my dad and me seeing the same therapist was uncomfortable, I'm not gonna lie), and he started seeing her. No difference. 

At the end of the summer I moved abroad. At that point my dad, who had always been a big man with a giant beerbelly, was underweight and looked old and fragile. He was living alone in our family home since my mom got her own apartment, and he was struggling financially. He had been talking to me a lot, since he felt like I was the only one to understand since I had been diagnosed years ago.  I asked him to promise me he wouldn't do anything stupid now that I was going to be gone - he said he couldn't make that promise. I moved away with a heavy heart and scared that one day I was going to wake up to a call from the hospital.

Fast forward to current time. Due to the corona virus I had to return back home for a few months. Just a few minutes ago I went into his room to ask him about something, and I walk in on him laying on the sofa talking to his new girlfriend on the phone and giggling like a teenager. In the last few months he completed a divorce group for men that really helped him, and now he is helping them plan for a new group - though he doesn't need it anymore.  He met this new woman through a dating app, and he seems to really like her. Him and my mom see each other every week, with her making him dinner and them going hiking together. They remained as friends.

I know how hard it can be for men to ask help, especially for their generation, and I'm so proud that he seeked help immediately. The lack of support groups for men is alarming, and I hope to see more of them in the future. Men deserve to be heard and helped without it making them feel weak. It made me so happy to see him happy, and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. The beerbelly is back, though I have to make sure it doesn't get as big as it used to be - physical health is important too after all.

This is lengthy, but writing it out made me smile. Stay safe guys, hopefully something made you smile today as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/g03ja4/depressed_dad_is_finally_starting_to_become_the/,2020-04-12 19:55:41,5,2,0

SuperGanondorf,"Reddit helped me discover my sexuality and understand myself in a totally new way, and I feel incredible","Over the last few months, I've been deeply depressed. This was due to a confluence of several factors, one significant one being the loneliness I feel at never having been in a relationship. I've only ever pursued a few relationships with close friends and not once has it ever worked out. I've tried a bit of casual dating here and there but I always felt a bit out of step with how the dating world works. 

The biggest event that made me feel that something was a bit off was sometime last year, when some friends and I were at a bar. My friend was explaining how to go about meeting potential dates at bars and the like, and he was talking about how you just have to find someone attractive and go talk to them. He asked me about the qualities I find attractive in a person, or what my type is, and I just had absolutely no answers. I tried to explain that I don't really care about looks much, and that I care more about personality and how I connect with somebody. His response was that those are definitely important factors, but when it comes to initiating contact, there needs to be something that draws you together, something that intrigues you about the other person. Not once in my life had I ever experienced a feeling like that, of being drawn to a total stranger, so while I understood the concept he was talking about, the feelings he described were totally foreign to me.

Now, a few weeks back I was browsing reddit. I wish I could remember what sub I was on, but I remember it was just some random, totally innocuous gaming or meme sub. I came across an interesting discussion where people were talking a little bit about this disconnect I've been feeling, and the tendency to be attracted to friends over strangers. That's where the word ""demisexual"" came up, a word I had never heard before.

For those unaware, a demisexual person is one who requires an emotional bond with another person before they can be sexually attracted to them. It's not a matter of the emotional connection being more important, or valuing personality over sex appeal, or anything like that; without the emotional bond, attraction just simply doesn't exist at all. It's a label that falls on the asexuality spectrum.

I related pretty strongly to this sentiment, and I started reading more about it. The more I read, the more I could relate. It felt like someone was basically writing about my own life. There's quite a few experiences common to demisexual people, like being really uncomfortable when someone you don't know well shows romantic interest or flirts with you. Or finding it really, really rare to have a crush or romantic interest in someone, and feeling it *extremely* intensely when you do. Or just not getting it when people talk about others being attractive or unattractive. I related to all of these experiences completely. 

At this point, I am comfortable with saying that I am demisexual.

For a long time, I thought I was in some sense broken, or emotionally damaged, for experiencing romance this way. For example, I would always be down on myself whenever something didn't work out with a friend I was interested in; I felt like part of my problem was that I was always getting too emotionally invested before even attempting to act on it. But I learned through all of the reading that I was doing that this is a common thing that demisexual people go through. Due to the way our attraction works, for some there is no middle setting between ""no romantic interest whatsoever"" and ""100% emotionally invested in the outcome of this romantic pursuit."" It's more like a flip of a switch than a spectrum of attraction and interest. Reading about this, and about how this is more about how I am wired and that there isn't something wrong with me for always getting invested in this way, brought me a lot of peace.

I learned through all this reading that this is an experience shared by many. I'm not broken at all, I just experience love and attraction in a way that's different to most people. There's nothing wrong with feeling this way; that's just how I'm wired. 

Today, I told my best friend about this. She's the first person I told, and in addition to wanting to share it with her, I also wanted to tell her as a way of ""trying on"" the label, if that makes sense. I know it felt right to me doing all this reading online, but I wasn't totally confident yet. I wanted to see if it still felt right when I described myself as demisexual to someone else, and explained my experience. And it really, really did. I felt like, for the first time ever, I could articulate exactly how I experience attraction to others, exactly what the disconnect I feel with how most people experience attraction and dating is, and exactly why I've had such a struggle finding someone to connect with in a romantic sense. Being the amazing friend that she is, of course she accepted all of this, asked questions, and listened to all of my experiences.

It felt *amazing*. I can't overstate how happy I am right now and how genuinely and completely *right* it felt to describe myself with the label of demisexual. I feel like I understand a huge part of myself that I didn't even know existed. I am happier right now than I can remember being in months.

I still have a long way to go, of course; this wasn't a magical cure for depression, and I am still going to therapy to better understand myself and work through a lot of the other issues I've been dealing with. I'm not totally sure if/how to come out to certain family and friends. And looking for love as a demisexual person comes with its own special set of challenges that I don't yet know how to go about overcoming. But I feel like I understand myself in a completely different and deeper sense than I did before, and I feel belonging and validation in a way that I didn't before. Today is the first time I've felt good about myself in a very, very long time, and I'm just so, so happy. It's hard to believe all of this came out of a reddit thread completely unrelated to any of this, but that things like this can happen is one of the many reasons I love this website. Now I can honestly say that it's changed my life.

If you read all the way here, thank you! I'm just really, really excited about all this and I felt like I absolutely had to share.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fy8bel/reddit_helped_me_discover_my_sexuality_and/,2020-04-10 04:28:07,1,2,0

ohThisUsername,"My manager rated me ""Exceeds expectations"" after being at my (dream) job for only 6 months.","I am a software software engineer. I consider myself to be very good at it, despite being extremely bad at almost every other aspect of life. I always felt like I was good at it, but I felt like I was sort of limited and not able to prove myself or get recognition for it (stuck at dead end jobs, etc). Like I said, it's really my only true skill in life, and I was beginning to think I was delusional and really had no skills after all. 

Anyway, \~6 months ago I moved to a different country and started my dream job at one of the biggest software companies on the planet. This alone was a HUGE accomplishment for me. However, I work with *extremely* smart people, and I was beginning to think I didn't belong and my performance was inadequate. I was blowing through deadlines on my tasks and felt like I just wasn't grasping some concepts despite asking over and over.

Today my manager gave me feedback on my performance review and said that I ""exceed expectations"" and it's almost unheard of for people to receive that rating being at the company for such a short time. I felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I can finally feel less stressed about how I'm performing and it has removed my doubts about not belonging and feeling like a fraud. I'll likely be promoted sooner than I expected too which is great.

BitOfANutcase,"I've struggled with depression for what seems like all my life, and for once I'm actually happy!","So it's kinda funny how long it took me to realise this, but I'm not depressed anymore! I've struggled with depression since I was 11, and I've always had a heavy feeling running in the background because of it. Every now and then, I end up having a good day, and I think wow, this is really awesome, but I still have to keep fighting. I've been in and out of therapy since I was 13, had to do my GCSE's in a unit and dropped out of college twice and tried to commit suicide twice throughout this time. Now I'm at the end of a two year college course that I didn't drop out of, I met my boyfriend of a year and a half in this course, and I'm finishing top of my class. In September, I'm moving out for university. I'll be living on my own in a different city to go to my first choice university and I was so afraid that I wouldn't be able to cope with it all mentally. Over the past couple weeks, due to the lockdown in my country, I've been taking things one day at a time. I don't know when it happened, whether it was so gradual that I didn't notice, or whether one day my brain just flipped a switch, but for the past couple days, at the end of each day I've thought 'wow, I've had a great day today, despite everything happening I feel good!' It was only today that I realised I haven't had many depressing thoughts over the past two weeks, if any at all! I'm happy without trying, and this realisation is only making me feel even better. Of course I miss my friends and my boyfriend, but even when I get sad because of not seeing the I'm still keeping a positive mindset. I honestly thought that I'd be the way I was forever, and I'd come to accept that, and maybe one day I'll find myself struggling again, but damn, I forgot how possible it is to feel so good every day! I love my life, and I love myself, finally. I can do anything I put my mind to! I wouldn't have been able to do it if I hadn't have surrounded myself with such positive people, namely my boyfriend.

Unicorncorn21,"Momentary bliss, may it last forever. I just hope I don't forget about the euphoria I felt tonight so I can remind myself why I'm still here","It's now 3:43 in the morning as I am writing this. I have no idea if it could have anything to do with this but today I have been consuming quite a bit of very emotional media like doki doki literature club for the 2nd time and binging evangelion again for like 5 hours. I wasn't really thinking of them but I think subconsciously they set the mood.

During the evening I was dissociating like crazy. In the shower I almost audibly gasped when I snapped out of dissociating and realized I am in fact not in Japan trying to sell a bike, but in my shower and had been for the last 20 or so minutes.

When I went to bed and started trying to sleep, I was very paranoid and was scared of looking at the glass window above my door because I was scared there would be something looking at me if I looked at it.

As I often do, I start taking heavy breaths and put on stone in focus by aphex twin in the background. I start to calm down and let my mind wonder wherever it goes. I keep thinking of the gorgeous pink sky that I stared at for almost an hour yesterday out if my window. I also think of ginger because I feel like it describes the bittersweetness of mood swings and how it feels both painful and sweet to eat at the same time, like life sometimes. I also start getting really emotional and think a lot about people I know and my future.

During all of this I feel euphoria I have literally never experienced before. I seriously feel like how it's supposed to be like when you take MDMA. I feel like I want to get all my shit together because I feel like I discovered beauty in life I have never seen before. I feel like I am in a better world even though nothing has changed. 

I'm sure of all of us have suddenly felt in the middle of the night that they want to lose weight, start taking school way more seriously etc. But this is way different. I don't feel like I need to do anything to be happier. Mentally I have reached a peak I have never before reached. 

The truth is it's starting wear off like a drug. It's been 30 minutes since I tried posting this for the first time in a different sub but it seemed like I was shadowbanned there. Fingers crossed not here. I admit I no longer feel like I mean all of this stuff, but I did when I wrote it. I just know that if I can somehow experience it again somehow it's a good enough reason to stick around on this earth. For a few hours I felt like I didn't have to be scared of anything.

I didn't want to forget how I feel so I (an hour ago) wrote a short poem about how it felt:

stooner,I finally have a job that appreciates me and what I do!,"Here's the only dark side of my story: I've been in IT for over 15 years, doing everything from help desk, programming, and various administration, but nothing rewarding ever came from them. No promotions, no gratitude, no anything. 

Matter of fact, my last job as a help desk / data analyst felt that an outsourced team of 5 could do my work. I was looking for a job since January. 

I've had nothing but support from my ""boss"" (Quotes because the one that is listed as my boss never managed, all issues went to my data analyst boss), coworkers, and the clients I served. It took several weeks before call backs started, and did they ever.  Of my 10 interviews,  I had 4 return interviews. One that I really wanted was one of them. Before long, I had an offer from one of the 4.

It was too low, but I accepted it begrudgingly. Then, an hour later, another position that I wanted, with a compatible rate offered. I told the first one no go, and started the paperwork on the 2nd. And, it stopped working. I emailed the rep, he said, ""well, don't do it on your phone."" Frustrated, I closed the browser on my desktop. My phone rings:

""Hey, Stooner, just wanted to let you know we're wanting to move forward with you, but we have some snags.""

I let them know about my other offers but I wanted this non profit organization (bear in mind, I have not heard their rate yet). The next day, I have an offer letter. 1.5x what I was making before. 

With a start date of March 9th. See where I'm going with this? Even after this, more offers came, but I turned them down.

The first US wave has hit, my first day, our company held a meeting to discuss the fallout. It would be all hands on deck should it get worse. That wed, it did. I was now one of the few that would be essential to help get working from home working. They never had a WFH policy before that moment. 

I would spent the next 3 days testing monitors, laptops, and mice for their use remotely. Everything just clicked. I had a solution to anything thrown at me, with approval, of course. 

Then, our state issues a stay at home order (Hint: it's not really, but that is all political), even more are starting to work from home. 

In the end, 68 of our 70 employees are working from home, I'm starting to relax in my office. 

Then, there's a knock on my door:

""Thank you for your grace, poise, and swiftness to get us all working."" And, I was presented with a thank you card and a ... quite sizable cash gift card.

I've never been appreciated like this before today, and this will likely be the first of many where I turn people's heads on their views of IT. 

On a different note, one of my interviews, I saw an old coworker listed as an interviewer for the job i was going for. I kinda wanted it, because it was analysis, but the vibe i was feeling from the interviewer was not that great, so at the end, ""Hey, if i don't get this job, at least give it to (coworkers name), he was my right hand man at an old company.""

XzKi103,Best place to live right now if you're in a risk group (according to me),"Hello!
I just thought I'd share something positive and heart warming in the middle of this whole Corona mess. 

My family has obviously been keeping up with the elderly in our extended family during all this to make sure they're doing ok. Firstly, my grandpa who doesn't quite understand what's going on and is almost refusing to stay inside. I've been getting him the newspaper and delivering it to his mailbox every other day (he really cares about reading it in his regular schedule haha) and we've been grocery shopping for him etc anytime he needs. This has proven fairly easy since he lives close to me. 

Secondly my grandma, who I was a bit worried about. She lives about two hours away from the rest of us in a pretty rural town here in Sweden, so going to run errands for her would not have been as easy. Anyhow, I call her to see how she's doing and make sure she has what she needs and I am now convinced her town is the best town to live right now if you're in a risk group. She tells me that she hasn't gone out in a week (now 3, this was 2 weeks ago) and that her grocery store and pharmacy started delivering food and medicine free of charge for everybody in town. Also, her retirement group came by with yarn for her so she could knit. So she was in the best mood saying she's been keeping busy with housework and talking on the phone to her best friend across the street while they sit in their windows looking at each other. All this just really warmed my heart and to me showed how people are really looking out for each other right now, so I thought I'd share.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ft8ty6/best_place_to_live_right_now_if_youre_in_a_risk/,2020-04-01 21:15:19,1,2,0

Chummmmmmmm,I’m confident with myself for the first time in years!,"For a long time, I lacked self esteem. I did not feel confident about myself at all, and I would constantly compare myself to others, and think “Why can’t I be like them.” I knew what was wrong, but I guess I didn’t care enough to fix it. Or something like that. Maybe I didn’t know how to fix it. I’m not sure. In the midst of all of that, I found a love for physical activity. It all started with that 100 push up per day challenge a couple years ago. I took that, and I began to work out more. I was a VERY skinny kid, just skin and bone really. I even had a muffin top going on... a little while into that, I finally drummed up the courage to ask out the most amazing woman a man could ever ask for, and she said yes! I still had no self confidence, low self esteem, and I would often get upset that I was not like others that I thought were ‘better’ than me. It took me a long time to realize that she loved ME and not what I thought I was supposed to be. Later on in our relationship, during last summer, I got myself a job that I absolutely love (my first one, and I still work there). Recently, I have finally dropped / am working on all of my bad habits and my perception of myself. Working out has given me self confidence (but I do not rely on it and I am perfectly fine with the body I have now) and my amazing girlfriend has given me the motivation I needed to get off my lazy ass and turn my mindset around, and for the first time in a very very long time, today I feel confident! I wish I could post pictures of how my life has taken a complete 180°, but I can only upload one :(.

I've about exhausted every dime I have and my credit cards are maxed. I have about 3 in a half weeks left in the program and I wasnt sure what I was going to do between now and the stimulus which I am beyond thankful for. I just got the mail for today and there was a letter from my bank. Enclosed was a check for 800$ for a gap insurance refund for my first car I totaled nearly 8 years ago. I am speechless I dont know what to think. I know it's not the case but i can only put it on my mom looking down and knowing i needed help. I knew nothing about such a refund or that I was owed anything. I mean gap insurance is to pay off your loan when you cant pay it so why would I be owed money? I'm in tears and just thanking her over and over and the universe too. I guess I had some good karma or something or maybe luck but I just needed to talk to someone about it.

msokou,Amazing Online Friends Through Video Games,"About a year ago, i was super into roblox and specifically this one roleplaying game. Anyways, they had a discord server so i decided to join and the people there were super nice, however there were a few people there who i talked to a lot. I wouldn't consider them my friends necessarily, but i guess they did. One night while we were talking, one guy suggested that we play cards against humanity. They were planning to make that a usual thing, so they made a discord server specifically for that, and to talk, play other games etc. We weren't allowed to post other links in the server so they were gonna dm the invite links. Now, i was not expecting to be invited, because like i said before, i didn't think of them as friends, but i did get the invite link :D

So we played CAH all night and it was super fun! We did this a few other times and i can't remember the reason as to why, but this one girl wanted to make a podcast and they were all up for it (including me). So they make the server and wanted to record an episode soon. They were asking for guests and while i would have loved to be on it, i have this really horrible mic that will literally stop working every now and then, and to be fair, i've always been self-conscious about my voice. We made a lot of new friends along the way, and all was well. One of the new people we met had made some remarks to the hosts of the podcast about killing themselves, wich got them banned from the server of course. Sadly enough, only went downhill from here :(

The hosts of the server are LGBTQ and two guys really didn't like the LGBTQ community and said some bad things about it, so they got banned. The server wasn't as active as it used to be, and some people left because why would you be in a server where the last message was a few weeks ago? At one point even one of the hosts left.

We literally went from more than 10 people to just 4. I tried starting a conversation recently, and it's nice to see everyone is doing good.

Honestly, this is the only (online) friendship i've ever been able to have for this long, so i'm glad i met all these amazing people :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fqn6ft/amazing_online_friends_through_video_games/,2020-03-28 16:19:04,1,1,0

Jennimae4u,Finally understand the true meaning of unconditional love.,"I was an addict in active addiction for 20 years and in a toxic marriage for 17 years. I separated from the ex husband and went to rehab. I’ve been clean for almost 2 years and in the process of finding myself I found true unconditional love. We were actually each other first bf/gf way back in school (we are both 41 now). Over the years we would reconnect but he was across the country and I was a mess. But over a year ago we reconnected, he ended up losing his eyesight and moving back to our hometown and I was divorced, clean and living life on life’s terms. After many months of talking and rediscovering each other we fell in love. This is the most pure, true unconditional love. We took things slow, we learned so much about each other. We didn’t rush into the sexual part of a relationship and by doing that we became so close, so connected, and built an incredible bond and foundation. He may be blind, but he sees the real me, and he is so in tune with my mind, heart, soul and body. It’s absolutely beautiful and breathtaking. I didn’t know this kind of love existed in real life , he is the definition of true love. I am so grateful, so appreciative, and so in love. We have been an official couple for almost 11 months. I just had to share. Stay safe and healthy everyone.

cinnisee,Care Package Ideas,"this may not be the right place to post this but if there is a better place to post, pls lmk in the comments ☺️


My work is “essential,” and while most of my coworkers have been sent home to work, myself and a few others still need to come in to the building every day. 
While I am grateful to still be healthy enough to come in to work, and still get paid while many others are not, the morale within my team of worker-bees is diminishing. 
I think it’s extremely important that my coworkers and I keep each other uplifted and positive during this time, and i don’t want our work place to be a place of pressure and stress while there is so much of that already out there in our day-to-day lives now. 

i would love to make small and safe care packages to give to my coworkers on Monday who are all willing to still come in and perform our essential duties. I want something to show them that i am thankful for their dedication and perseverance, and i want them to remember that WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER (despite being six feet apart lol). i want my team to know that we are STILL a unit, and that we can still care for each other during this incredibly trying and difficult time. 

i would love some ideas of how i can do this safely, or if you can think of some other way besides care packages, please share! i will do anything to show my gratitude to these people, and lift their spirits so we can continue to look towards the light at the end of this long, dark tunnel.

Not sure if this is the correct place to post this but I just had to share with someone how incredibly happy I am. I’ve had a rough past and have struggled with so many things; trauma, abuse, depression, self harm, eating disorder, attempts to take my own life, addiction etc. 

I honestly never thought I would experience anything close to happiness, but despite all the craziness happening in our world right now I can finally say that I’m happy. 

I put myself through a phlebotomy program at a community college and I start my first job as a phlebotomist next Monday at an amazing clinic with great pay and benefits. 

This is one of the first times I’ve ever been proud of myself and for the first time I feel like I actually have control over my life. In addition, this new job has given me the stability I need to do something I’ve always wanted: adopt a kitty! 

My partner and I are in the process of adopting two kittens (they’re sisters). This post may seem lame compared to what other people post but I really can’t believe that this is my life. For once, things are just falling into place for me, and I couldn’t be happier.

I’m so happy I stuck around for this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fo06ss/after_so_many_years_of_being_depressed_and_hating/,2020-03-24 06:14:27,1,1,0
murdermittensjuju,Becoming friends with my neighbor and gaining a battle buddy!,"A couple of weeks ago I met one of my neighbors. As my husband and I were leaving our apartment she was going back to hers. She stopped me to have a chat, I could immediately tell how sweet and shy was. I took the time to chat with her and made friends with her two dogs, she was going through a depressive episode, so I gave her my number. 
I didn’t hear from her for weeks. Which was fine!

Just as this virus scare started to become prevalent in the US we wound up chatting, again, in our parking lot. She expressed all of her fears, worries, and theories about this scare, and we definitely bonded. 

We have become battle buddies in a sense and text often or chat in our parking lot often. 

Fast forward to today; we are having banter about our diets (she is vegan and I am vegetarian), she mentions she is eating tempeh, and I mention how I couldn’t find any or even tofu, and how how I wish I had some!

A minute goes by and she says “I left some in front of your door”, I grab a sanitizing wipe, and sure as shit she left and unopened package of tempeh for me!!!

This was such a cute and sweet little highlight to my day! I am grateful to me making such a good neighborly friend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fnsnn9/becoming_friends_with_my_neighbor_and_gaining_a/,2020-03-23 21:43:58,1,2,0

I came back home and made myself some delicious breakfast. Did not turn the tv on.  I sat and ate alone at my dining room table and focused on each bite and each sip of water.  I listened to a motivational morning podcast as I ate and then took my vitamins. And then I meditated.

Every other night of this lock down we have been eating in sweats on the couch in front of the TV. This was such a welcomed change that I have woke up smiling and can't stop!

Day 6 of No School and Home Stay: We finally got through the day, and then, at bedtime, I made up a story about 2 brothers and a sister who were called ""Stinky Bros &amp; Sis."" They were siblings who fart with every interaction. They run a business that uses their farts to fly hot air balloons and go-carts. I pretty much ended every sentence with fart noises..

I can't even tell you the laughter from them. Roaring laughter. It's easy to forget with all that's going on in the world, how deliciously funny farts are to kids (and adults).

Parent tip: Don't tell fart stories right before bed. They'll never go to sleep. So, that part backfired a bit. 🤦",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fn1uq8/made_up_a_story_about_farts_for_my_kids_and_they/,2020-03-22 15:59:08,1,6,0

On our last day in the lab My boss gave us all a care package of gloves, surgical masks, and alcohol pads. He fought hard and was able to keep everyone one the payroll without having to use sick days or personal time. And he has us do a video conference twice a week to chit chat, gossip, catch up on out home projects, and help keep us sane. He even encourages us to bring our pets in on the video conferences as our “lab assistants”.

Almost not real. All day, every day i just feel so happy and inspired. Wanting people to hear what ive been thinking and see what ive created because i feel like maybe someone can relate to me. Or connect. At the end of the day, when i eat my edibles, it intensifies the feeling of happiness and it feels overwhelming but in a good way.

Yet, I'm at my happiest when I'm just doing my own thing. This came to me recently due to the self isolation epidemic and seeing a lot of people complain of boredom, and the need to socialise.

Spac3xJ3sus,"Random acts of kindness make you feel better, I promise.","So, last night I was playing fortnite with my roomie/our homie and decided to go outside for a cigarette. Sitting on the front porch of our apt complex just past 10pm, an older man walks up the sidewalk maybe 20 feet in front of me. 

“Excuse, me, can I ask you a question?” He says. “What?” I say back a little hesitantly, as my city is known for high rates of crime. “Listen, sir, I don’t mean to bother you or disrespect you in any way sir, I’d shake your hand but with all the virus stuff..” — “yeah that’s fine I understand. What’s up?” I ask him. He sits down, “So, I was just released from **** prison and they gave me this,” shows me his release papers and some piece of notebook paper with poorly scribbled instructions, “I just did 6 years and they let me out today and I was down the street at the bars and I asked this man if he could spare me any change, I just need 6.95 for the bus man and he threw a quarter at me and said “here you go n**,” I looked at him in horror as he said that last part, “dude what? are you serious? that’s fucked up man nobody deserves that...” I didn’t know what else to say. He said the bouncer came over and kicked the guy out after witnessing the entire thing. “So please man, I’m hungry, Im tired, I just want to go home and see my family..” he said as he started to cry. 

Quick aside, I’m not sure if any of you have seen a grown man cry, but to see that level of despair in a person is gut wrenching. 

“Hold on, Ill be right back.” I said “oh, okay, thank you sir.” he said, sitting on the bench still. I went into the complex and grabbed as much change as i could fit in my hand and then looked in my wallet. There was a 20$ bill in it. I stood there for maybe 3 seconds, before grabbing it and stashing it in my pocket. I went back outside, to see him still sitting there crying, head in his hands. 

“Hey man, this is all the change I had,” i said, pouring it into his hand “thank you sir really thank you so much,” he started to try and thank me, “but here,” i pulled out the bill, “go home and see your family.” He leapt from his seat and hugged me. “THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH OH THANK YOU LORD THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!” he couldn’t stop himself. “Go home.” I said kindly again as I patted his back, finally being released from the bear hug of a stranger. He started off, still hollering thank yous, literally jumping up in the air kicking his heels with excitement as I walked back inside. 

I didn’t tell my roomie or our buddy what I did. I have no idea what that man is going to do with that money. But, I have a feeling he wasn’t lying to me. To open up with honesty about having just been released from prison, I felt like what he said after that was sincere. He just wanted to go home and see his family. 

The world is a very trying place, some of us have it much easier than others. And right now we’re all facing something exceptionally challenging with this global pandemic changing social life entirely. We should always remember to treat our fellow humans with dignity, respect, and kindness, ESPECIALLY, in times like these. We are being tested as a species and we must not fail. We have to work together in order to make it out of this. All over the world, people will lose loved ones. Brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, friends. 

“Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.” 

We are all entrenched in a battle right now. Divided we are weak, Unified we are strong. 

KEEP GOING! LETS GO CHAMP!  NOW GO, MAKE IT A GREAT DAY!!!!! ✌🏻🤟🏻🤘🏻

It makes me happy that, finally, no matter what happens, I will have someone, my best friend, and she will be there for me whatever happens, just as much we I will be there for her no matter what happens. It feels so good to finally trust someone again.

I always worried so much, was so dramatic, stayed with my problems for so long, had a lot of anxiety... All this happened after my wife cheated on me and left me.

Also, I want to write my own cartoon when I grow up, so I partially write because I want to learn how to put stories together on my own time.

School also gets busy and stressful from time to time (not counting coronavirus), and I have a feeling that when I enter charter school, it'll become even more hectic. (The fact that I got in is a double happy post in and of itself.)

I used to love video games, but then I made a conscious decision not to play them when they started taking up precious writing/homework time -this was before I scrapped a stressful story and established a schedule. Now that I finally have time to play video games due to no school, it just feels like I'm doing it 'cause my work timeslot is gone and I need to fill it with something.

Basically, I need hobbies that are relaxing and not time-consuming.

Well, a few months ago, I was digging around in the never-used drawer of my bedside table (due to cleaning) and found an old recorder I hadn't touched since third grade. Yes, *that* recorder that parents and children alike remember with a certain sense of scorn. Out of curiosity, I decided to play that old instrument.

Apparently I was good enough to not blow everyone's ears out on first try -and in fact, I was surprisingly skilled at it even though I hadn't done it in years. I left it on my bedside table and played it every once in a while. My desire to do music was sort of rekindled by Steven Universe, so I started replicating songs on the recorder with some difficulty.

Well, I was later told to move my recorder off the bedside table because of some idiotic rule that there were no more than two items on a surface so the house would sell (definitely not happening now, lol), and chose to take it downstairs to the side table next to the couch. (Said couch was replaced by two chairs.)

This combined with my habit of being downstairs and my increased desire to sing (long story) revived the spark of my appreciation for music. I started playing the recorder more and more, to the point of doing it out of boredom when I didn't feel like writing.

And now, here I am, loving my recorder so much that when I'm waiting for day to arrive in a specific video game, I play along to the nighttime soundtrack. My fingers just flow on the recorder so quickly and easily. It's relaxing.

Yesterday, I got acceptance letters for charter school under the writing department, and oddly enough, I also received a paper of other class options that were all music-related. I am mildly interested in the woodwind option and would pick it up if it were a one-semester thing, except it's a major class from the music department and I worry that if I pick it without needing to, it'll be more intense than I have time for and my already-hectic homework load from writing will become even more hectic. (If I am required to pick a music class, I'd pick the woodwinds in a heartbeat.) I could get around this by asking for private lessons outside of school. I hated my old piano lessons because it involved formalities like recitals and exams, and I was on someone else's rather strict schedule and rules instead of mine. Plus, for me, treating as a second school and not a hobby defeats the purpose of me wanting to relax by playing music myself. All I have in mind is just something I'm casually interested in, no formalities or real schooling involved. I could get around this by, once again, asking for an instructor with looser guidelines and no real formalities.

Basically, I'm considering some kind of non-complicated woodwind instrument that's slightly more complicated than the recorder that I can treat as a relaxing hobby.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fkdlph/found_a_potential_hobby_that_under_the_right/,2020-03-17 21:36:09,1,3,0
mychildhoodgone,There are GOOD PEOPLE out there during this hard time...,"With everything going on in the world at the current moment, it's scary. Having a job is scary. Going outside is scary.

I (23F) have two jobs, I am an Instructional Assistant at a College part-time and the other part-time I work as an Intern in NYC for a Non Profit. And I cannot stress enough, how HAPPY I am with these two jobs. Left and right I have heard many friends talk about how their companies are letting them go, while I am not. I am not bragging. I am not trying to boast. I am just so grateful!

Today, while speaking with one of my managers from new york on the phone he stated that he wants to keep me as busy as possible so that I do not have to lose any hours so that I can keep getting paid. Then he proceeded to send me a motivational email, thanking me for helping him out. No kind sir, THANK YOU for caring about a little intern. I cannot stress this enough, that he made me day. He made my week, hell he even made my year. While my other boss recommended cutting down my hours, this guy is working hard for me, to keep me working. Thank you, kind sir. You do not know how much this means to me during this time. 

And as for being a TA the teacher I work for is wonderful and is flexible, understanding, and is working hard to both support us and our needs, as well as all the student's needs. She even went to the housing department at our college to fight for students right to stay on campus, since she is homeless. This woman CARES. This man CARES. There are good people in the world during horrible times. Please remember that.

makemewanna-fry,Being a part of a small locally owned business is really tough at the moment but customers make it worth staying open.,"I understand most people who work in service at the moment don’t want to be at work and I totally respect that. But I work at a local, family-owned cafe. My bosses have four young children and this is their only source of income. My coworkers may hate working right now, but I am so content. We’re only doing take-out and call-ins, and everyone I’ve served has been so incredibly kind. Hearing people say “I hope the cafe makes it through all of this.” “We will support any way we can.” “Stay safe.” “I’m thinking of you guys.” “We want you to stay afloat.” It genuinely makes me tear up. Yes, I barely make above minimum wage, and yes I am putting myself at risk. But in the long run I’m helping a family stay afloat. I don’t have my family around anymore and these people accepted me as one of them. I just really feel grateful to everyone supporting local businesses through the pandemic.

NewEnglandSynthOrch,"Almost four years ago, I built my first PC and it has been a joy ever since","OK, I realize that this could easily go on r/pcmasterrace, but considering how much joy it's brought me, I might as well post about it here.

Ever since I first played the online game *World of Tanks* back in 2012, I decided that one day, I was gonna get a PC powerful enough to at least run it smoothly on decent settings. Then, when I got my first job in 2015, I decided that building my own PC was gonna be the best way to accomplish this. I had to put off my dream for about a year because I was using money not only to get a car, but also to buy Christmas gifts for my whole family.

Fast-forward to 2016, and now that I had the money, I read various articles on Wikihow and Lifehacker about how to go about doing it. Once I had the know-how and the parts, I spent much of Sunday, July 24, 2016 building the thing, and once it was all put together, I capped off that day by watching the John Carpenter movie *Dark Star*. Unfortunately, when I went to turn it on the next day, it wouldn't fire up. I got depressed at the possibility of having to buy new parts for it, so I asked my second-youngest brother - who probably frequents this wonderful website somewhere - to help me iron out the bugs. 

Owing to a family vacation and unfavorable scheduling issues on my brother's part, he wasn't able to come over (we lived in different houses at the time) to check it out until Friday, August 12, 2016. Fortunately, with his help, I got all the bugs ironed out. As it turned out, the installation of the graphics card had interfered with the power supply actually being able to turn the computer on. On a lesser note, a RAM chip also hadn't been seated properly. 

Nevertheless, once those were out of the way, installing the operating system and the graphics card drivers was a snap, and my 1st PC build has made gaming awesome ever since. Granted, it has had an occasional blue screen of death, and it's not exactly the most powerful terminal on the block, but still, it's good enough for what I need it to do, and that makes me happy.

NuclearNovaBomb,Happy Pi Day! It’s also my first anniversary with my SO after my divorce.,"Happy Pi Day!

My first anniversary with my boyfriend is today.

We met after my divorce and his 6 year relationship on r/breakup’s discord. I don’t recommend that whatsoever. We were just best friends who ended up being platonic until I realized what a great guy he was. CA (me) -&gt; TX (him). 9 months later, I moved. Some growing pains have come up lately, but that’s expected.

We put aside our grievances and had a good time. Best. Day. Ever. 

We got banh mi’s and ca phe sua da’s, then we went to the shelter to look at and spend time with the cats and dogs while contemplating adopting a new baby. 

After, I got my nails done while my boyfriend tried to salvage what was left of the canned soup and hot dogs at the grocery store, as well as bagels. When he came to grab me from the salon, he got a free margarita. He was happy.

He surprised me with flowers, we smoked some flower at home , and then we went to a cool Japanese Texas bbq fusion place. After, we got boba, went home and got faded and chilled. 

He asked me to pop his back and I obliged. While climbing over me, I added dirty talk about wanting him to hang his participle in my face. He climbed over me while I was under him and I squeezed hard. Out comes a nice ripple crack in his spine and a nice ripple clap in his crack. In comes the ugly crying laughs and wheezing. 

I hope everyone finds a love like this.

I had a reddit account for some 2~ months that had accrued some 2k+ karma on it. After my ER visit I decided I needed to change a lot of things in my life, including my reddit username. So, a new me was born, both in reality and online. In the last 6 days since I made this account I have already reached over 1k karma, and I know it might seem like a strange goal to reach for, but reddit became and is now a big part of my life, and this feels like I did something right. Like, I was able to put out enough kind energy into the world within the last week to make up for what I did to myself, and to kind of re balance my image.

witch-bitch-,My S/O and I finally confessed our love for each other.,"We’ve been seeing each other for a year, it was casual up until a month ago. I’ve been in love with him for a while, and I finally realized that I love him back in December. We complement each other well, I’ve never had a feeling someone was “the one” up until now. He shows me what love is supposed to feel like and how someone is supposed to treat their spouse. 

Each day we’d hang out (which was once or twice a week) id fall even more in love with him. The way he laughs, his smile, those beautiful bright blue eyes that make me feel like I’m home. This was my first time actually loving someone and I finally realized love is supposed to make you feel good. 

We made our relationship official on 2/24/2020 and the spark between us feels more ignited than it ever had before. We had this incredible chemistry on our first date and we kept getting closer and closer. 

Fast forward to last Wednesday I told him I had something to tell him. I had been wanting to tell him I love him and had been working up the courage for weeks. I finally couldn’t hold it in anymore and had to tell him. I wanted to wait until he said it first so that I knew he was ready, but I figured if he wasn’t I’d tell him he could wait until he was ready. 

It took me 30 minutes to get it out, I was so nervous. I don’t tell people I love them unless I truly do, it’s something that is really important to me and shouldn’t be thrown out to just anyone. First I asked him if he thought I was funny before I said it, it’s just the relationship we have we are two very comedic people. He was giving me the slightest push to finally come out with it and just started singing songs that had I love you in it but wanted me to fill in the blank. 

I finally say it and he says it back, my heart absolutely bursted. A few minutes later I asked him to say it again and he says it. It was the happiest I’ve ever been my heart was fluttering, he walks me to my car and asks me to say it again. I did and we just stood there holding and kissing each other for a good five minutes. 

This morning I turn over to him in bed and tell him I love him. He says I love you and gives me a big kiss good morning, we were still a bit sleepy but all the love in the world was still there. I’m so certain he’s the one I’ll marry, I never wanted kids but it’s different with him. That’s how I know the love is true.

2 (2) Abuse (Note: Some say - Akkosa Sutta: Insult – translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in

the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. The brahmin

Akkosaka Bharadvaja, Bharadvaja the Abusive, heard ""It is

said that the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan has gone forth from

the household life into homelessness under the ascetic Gotama.""

**Angry** and displeased, he approached the Blessed One and

abused and reviled him with rude, harsh words.

When he had finished speaking, the Blessed One said to him:

""What do you think, brahmin? Do your friends and colleagues,

kinsmen and relatives, as well as guests come to visit you?""

""Sometimes they come to visit, Master Gotama.""

""Do you then offer them some food or a meal or a snack?""

""Sometimes I do, Master Gotama.""

""But if they do not accept it from you, then to whom does the

food belong?""

""If they do not accept it from me, then the food still belongs to

us.""

""So too, brahmin, we-who do not abuse anyone, who do not

scold anyone, who do not rail against anyone-refuse to accept

from you the abuse and scolding and tirade you let loose at us.

It still belongs to you, brahmin!

""Brahmin, one who abuses his own abuser, who scolds the

one who scolds him, who rails against the one who rails at

him-he is said to partake of the meal, to enter upon an

exchange. But we do not partake of your meal; we do not enter

upon an exchange. It still belongs to you, brahmin!""

""The king and his retinue understand the ascetic Gotama to be

an arahant, yet Master Gotama still gets angry.""

(Note: Some sources said:

… yet, Do Master Gotama still gets angry?)

\[The Blessed One:\]

""How can anger arise in one who is angerless,

In the tamed one of righteous living, 

In one liberated by perfect knowledge,

In the Stable One who abides in peace?

""One who repays an angry man with anger

Thereby makes things worse for himself.

Not repaying an angry man with anger,

One wins a battle hard to win.

""He practises for the welfare of both-

His own and the other's-

When, knowing that his foe is **angry,**

He mindfully maintains his peace.

(Note: Some sources said:

He/she who knows the other is angry and can still his mind and be conscious,

it can be said that he/she does for benefits of both parties that are him/herself and the other.)

""When he achieves the cure of both-

His own and the other's-

The people who consider him a fool

Are unskilled in the Dhamma.""

(Note: Some sources said:

When he/she preserve the benefits of both parties that are him/herself and the other,

those who are not intelligent in Dhamma will think that he/she is a fool.)

When this was said, the brahmin Akkosaka Bharadvaja said to

the Blessed One: ""Magnificent, Master Gotama!. . . I go for refuge

to Master Gotama, and to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu

Sangha. May I receive the going forth under Master Gotama,

may I receive the higher ordination!'

Then the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan received the going

forth under the Blessed One, he received the higher ordination.

And soon, not long after his higher ordination, dwelling alone

... ... the Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the

arahants.

///////////////

The above is the second Sutta in Brahmanasamyutta. I (writer) will now talk about 1st – 5th Sutta which are also directly related to the matters of anger (5 out of 10 Suttas so to keep this article short and brief).

The first Sutta said about the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan. He saw Dhananjani praised and had confidence in the Blessed One, he then tried to go and refuted with the Blessed One. Angry and displeased, he asked:

""Having slain what makes one sleep soundly?

Having slain what makes one not sorrow?

What is the one thing, O Gotama,

Whose killing you approve?""

\[The Blessed One:\]

""Having slain anger, one sleeps soundly;

Having slain anger, one does not sorrow;

The killing of anger, O brahmin,

With its poisoned root and honeyed tip:

This is the killing the noble ones praise,

For having slain that, one does not sorrow.""

The brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan then praised the Blessed One and ordained. And later, he became one of the arahants.

(Then in 2nd Sutta above, Akkosa then angry (probably because the 1st is his friend? And Akkosa didn’t like it when a friend started believing in something else / someone else :D) and came meet the Buddha, angrily.)

The Third Sutta, Asurindaka, in Brahmanasamyutta said about The Brahmin Asurindaka Bharadvaja.

Asurindaka Bharadvaja also heard the same as Akkosaka. He then came with anger and displeased to abused (scolded) the Blessed One. When he finished, the Blessed One remained silent, he continued: ""You're beaten, ascetic! You're beaten, ascetic!""

\[The Blessed One:\]

""The fool thinks victory is won 

When, by speech, he bellows harshly;

But for one who understands,

Patient endurance is the true victory.”

(Some sources said:

Those who speak rude words thinks he/she has won.

But Patient endurance is the true victory for the wise one.)

(From here same as Akkosa)

""One who repays an angry man with anger

Thereby makes things worse for himself.

Not repaying an angry man with anger,

One wins a battle hard to win.

""He practises for the welfare of both-

His own and the other's-

When, knowing that his foe is **angry,**

He mindfully maintains his peace.

""When he achieves the cure of both-

His own and the other's-

The people who consider him a fool

Are unskilled in the Dhamma.""

Asurindaka Bharadvaja then praised the Blessed One and ordained. And later, he became one of the arahants.

The 4th Sutta said about The Brahmin Asurindaka Bharadvaja. He also heard the same as Akkosaka. Angry and displeased, he approached the Blessed One and silently stood to one side.

Then the Blessed One knew his thought and said to him:

""If one wrongs an innocent man,

A pure person without blemish,

The evil falls back on the fool himself,

like fine dust thrown against the wind.""

(Some sources said:

He/she who harms one, who harms no one, who is pure, who has no desire.

The sin will definitely return to him/herself who is Rascal.

Just like those who throw fine dust against the wind.)

The Brahmin Asurindaka Bharadvaja then praised the Blessed One and ordained. And later, he became one of the arahants.

The 5th Sutta said about The Brahmin Ahimsaka Bharadvaja. (This one wasn’t angry at the Buddha.)

He said to the Blessed One: ""I am Ahimsaka the Harmless, Master Gotama. I am Ahimsaka the Harmless, Master Gotama.""

\[The Blessed One:\]

""If one were as one's name implies

You would be a harmless one.

But it is one who does no harm at all

By body, speech, or mind,

Who really is a harmless one

As he does not harm others.""

(Some sources said:

""If his/her name is Ahimsaka,

He/she should not harm others.

He/she who truly does no harm via body, speech, or mind,

his/her name truly is Ahimsaka"")

Note: By now, we can understand that Ahimsaka means A harmless one.

The Brahmin Ahimsaka Bharadvaja then praised the Blessed One and ordained. And later, he became one of the arahants.

Recap/Summary:

1st Sutta: Eliminate anger / Don’t get angry, and one will be happy.

2nd Sutta: Don’t exchange angrily with those who angry at you.

3rd Sutta: Patient endurance is the true victory for the wise one.

4th Sutta: Sin / bad Results sill return to those who harm others. (Which the bad results will be explained more in other suttas)

5th Sutta: To truly be a harmless one, one must not harm others via body, speech, or mind.

A bit Extra: And to achieve this, one must also practice his/her mind by meditation.

End: When the Buddha was scolded.
